										<p style="text-align: center;">Chapter Three</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> RESPONSIBILITIES OF A YOUTH LEADER (2)</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you are a leader, lead and keep on
      leading. What will show to all that you are really leading is your ability
      to carry out all the responsibilities effectively. Do not just resume in
      the office, assume the responsibilities of the office.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Having enumerated the three major needs of
      a youth in the first chapter, the major responsibility of any
      youth leader then will be to meet these paramount needs of the
      youth. Anyone, leader or follower, who meets these needs is automatically
      seen by the youths as their leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> One surefire way to meet all of these needs
      put together is by showing you care for them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>SHOW YOU CARE</b><br>
      I have stumbled on this statement a number of times and I believe what it
      says. Its truth is relevant to the issue under consideration; people do
      not care how much you know until they know how much you care.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> All youth leaders are encouraged to write
      this out in black on a plain white sheet and paste it right beside their
      bedside where it is seen every morning. Leadership is not, most times,
      about how much you know but how much you care.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The unending quest for knowledge in most
      youth gatherings may make the leadership mantle always fall on the most
      knowledgeable one around, without minding how little he cares. However, as
      soon as this leader who has been chosen based on his knowledge and ability
      steps into the position of leadership, more will be demanded from him than
      he can offer. His success is now measured not only by how much he knows,
      but also by how much he cares; and if he fails in the latter, no matter
      his degree of success in the former, he will end up having problems with a
      majority of his followers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Most leaders sincerely feel that placing
      such a high demand of care on them, coupled with all the selfless efforts
      and other contributions they have to make for the advancement of the unit,
      is like asking for too much. So, if you feel the same way, you are not
      alone. Others before you have felt the same; and countless number of
      others coming after you will still feel the same. Their feelings have
      never changed the people’s opinion; neither will it ever change it. The
      only solution is to be ready to meet up with the demands by showing to
      your followers that you indeed care.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Your relationship with every one of your
      followers is important. Men are naturally drawn to those who show them
      love. They easily flow with those who care about them and are always
      deeply committed to those who are concerned about their personal progress.<br>
      Having a personal relationship with them enhances their contribution to
      your endeavors. Your focus should not be mainly on the project but on the
      students you use to carry out the project. They should be more important
      to you than the project because without them, hardly can the project move.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If leadership is all about people, then the
      key to successful leadership will be learning to get along with people,
      caring for them, and caring about them. If you are only committed to the
      success of your goals, and are not committed to the people you intend to
      use to accomplish the goals, you will most likely, meet a brick wall as
      time goes on. The more progressive your people get under you
      administration, the more interested they get in your dreams. The more
      committed and devoted they become in your dream, the more success your
      regime achieves.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The foundational principle for leadership
      is love and care for followers. Every other thing depends on it. If you
      really want to influence men or you desire that they follow as you lead,
      first make a personal investment in their lives, and you will see them
      glued to you and your dream. If you can succeed in making them realize how
      important they are to you first, getting them to realize how important
      they are to your dream will be easy.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Some of the most gifted and most talented
      people around have difficulties leading others because they have very poor
      human relations. They rely on their gifts and talents so much that they
      neglect the place of human resources. This always tells adversely at a
      later time in their lives. If you want to get along with the youths of
      today, you need an amiable and caring personality.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Do not care more about power than people.
      Care less about how much authority you have, and much more about how many
      lives you can impact. No one ever regrets showing love in the long run.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> One major advantage of showing love to them
      is that they are able to put up with your faults and shortcomings and
      tolerate your mistakes and failures or probably overlook them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Another is that it will also make them more
      submissive to your authority. It is quite hard to argue with people who
      really love you. You only force yourself into such arguments when it
      becomes really necessary. The respect which the person has earned himself
      by showing love to you makes it almost impossible for you to want to have
      any serious argument with him. If you show your followers genuine care and
      love, you will get them more committed to you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The youth leader’s best assets are people.
      Nothing can be done without them. Be friendly to them. Be helpful. Be
      cordial. Have a good inter-personal relationship. Do not only be
      interested in what they can contribute to your goals. Be genuinely
      interested in them too, especially your immediate work force. If this is
      not done, they may begin to see you as a selfish leader who is only
      interested in his own goals alone, for his own selfish interest and hidden
      agenda.<br>
      Spend more time in developing good rapport with people. Leadership is all
      about relating with others. When you relate</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">well, you become a good leader. If you do
      not, you are termed the opposite.<br>
      Build deep relationships with your followers by spending time with them.
      To be loved, you love first. Your success is deeply rooted in your
      willingness to invest time in establishing cordial
      relationships.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>HOW TO SHOW YOU CARE</b><br>
      The level of care and concern youths expect today from their leaders today
      is higher than it was in previous generations. To lead youths in this
      generation, you need both a hard mind and a soft heart. The hard mind will
      help you lead them through the turbulent waters and the soft heart will
      help you to get along with your people successfully.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> In this age, you cannot afford to lead from
      afar, else you will lose the people you are meant to lead. You need to
      move close to them; get to know them’ know their needs; be genuinely
      interested in their interests too. You will operate better this way.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> These few advices below will help you to
      show the needed care to the youths you have been called to lead.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>BE A GOOD LISTENER</b><br>
      Most of the youths who come to you with their problems really do not need
      a miracle-working problem solver; all they need is a listening hear. And
      this is what they lack.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Many of them have issues and great secrets
      to share, but they cannot confide in their parents at home for fear of
      being crucified. Their lecturers in school behave as though they are gods
      and their offices are no go areas for any personal issue. The closest of
      their friends and classmates will not take them seriously, and may even
      mock them later. So, they have no confidants. Be their confidant. Whether
      you can help them or not, do them the honor of listening whenever they
      need someone to talk to.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Silence is a great part of communication.
      You really do not have to fill every vacuum in a discussion with words.
      You do not have to talk unless you need to. So many of them will get a lot
      of relief simply by talking to you and knowing that you are listening to
      all they have to say; you will be more loved than ever before.<br>
      Being a good listener is the key to a cordial relationship between leaders
      and followers. On your own part, listening will give you a better
      understanding of what they are going through. On their own part, it
      increases their trust in you. If man needs training to be a good speaker,
      then he definitely needs training to be a good listener. Both do not come
      naturally.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> So, train yourself to be a good speaker if
      need be. When listening, hear more than the words. Pay attention to
      people’s tones and other nonverbal behaviors.<br>
      One quality of a good listener is that he knows the appropriate responses.
      The response may not be in words alone. It could be a smile, a grin, a
      wink, a sigh, a pat on the back, or on the shoulder, a hug and other
      non-vocal actions too numerous to mention. All these are skills that need
      to be learnt with time if you must be a successful leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you eventually talk at the end of the
      day, some of them will have solutions to their problems by listening to
      what you have to say, and they will attribute these solutions to you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you will take the time needed to be a
      good listener, it will not only make you a better solution provider, it
      will also make you understand the people you are leading, and in no time,
      you will become the people’s man.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>BECOME AN INTIMATE FRIEND</b><br>
      Youths really do not appreciate leadership as much as they appreciate
      friendship. If you come as their leader, they are likely to keep you at a
      distance. To get the best cooperation from them, become their friends.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Do not just lord it over them. Irrespective
      of your age, come to their level. They will not initiate friendship with
      you, at least most of them will not. So, be the first to get close to
      them. Genuinely become their friends and you will discover that most of
      the things they naturally will hide from the other leaders, you will be
      privy to.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> However, be careful. Do not segregate. Do
      not be a friend to those whose parents are rich and neglect those who seem
      to be less privileged. You will be courting trouble. Be a friend to all,
      both the straight and the wayward. Although you should not approve of his
      wayward lifestyle by doing anything to encourage it, but you should still
      be his friend anyway. Use every opportunity you have to let him know that
      what he is doing is bad, but still love him anyway. Remember, while we
      were yet sinners, Christ died for us!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>BE INTERESTED IN THEIR ACADEMICS</b><br>
      Another way in which to show that you care is to show genuine interest in
      their academics. Encourage them to make their academics a priority. Since
      most of them are likely still going to be students, you ask how each of
      them (or as many of them as you can) are faring academically, what
      challenges they are facing with other students, what challenges they are
      facing with problematic lecturers, what courses are causing them restless
      nights.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Where you can help out by your influence
      and position, do so wholeheartedly. Where you cannot, contact those who
      you know can help them on your behalf. Where the whole thing is beyond
      your ability, words of advice, counsel and consolation will go a long way.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Their performance in their academics must
      bother you as much as it bothers them. The only thing they still cherish
      most in their lives, today, is their academics. This is where they intend
      to build a future. If they falter academically and the school authority
      kicks them out, they become automatically discouraged with life and lose
      out on their destiny.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Show genuine concern in their academics,
      and they will be overly grateful to you. Until they know you are on their
      side, they probably will not come to your side.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>INSPIRE THEM IN THEIR SECULAR PURSUIT</b><br>
      They all may not necessarily be students. Some may already be in the labor
      market. Do your best to inspire them in their secular pursuits. Encourage
      them from time to time. Ask about their</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
											<p style="text-align: justify;">relationship with their bosses, seniors,
      colleagues and juniors in the office.<br>
      Ask how they are coping with the pressures of work. Challenge them to be
      better employees and portray themselves as good examples of the believer.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you have any materials that
      could help them to improve at work, such as management books, training
      cds, seminar handouts, loan them with a promise from them to return at a
      specified time so that it will be available for others to use as well.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Lastly, find out if they are satisfied with
      the job or if they are there temporarily. If they really are not satisfied
      with it, join them in prayers, believing God for a better one. If the
      person in question is credible, you can make recommendation to others who
      can help him/her. Doing this will show that you are really interested in
      their progress.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>CARE ABOUT THEIR PURPOSE IN LIFE</b><br>
      Beyond whatever job each of them is engage with presently, and beyond the
      academics of those who are in school, be interested in their purpose in
      life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> What do they want to become in the near
      future and on the long run? What do they want out of life? After all said
      and done, what do they want to be remembered for in life?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Some of them have not started thinking
      about this. It will not even be wrong to say some of them do not even know
      what their purpose in life is. Help them to discover it. Open their eyes
      to the great untapped resources which they have inside them, and help them
      tap into these. They will always remember you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>MEDIATE BETWEEN THEIR PARENTS AND THEM</b><br>
      A good youth leader is a mediator between the youths and their parents.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is not uncommon for youths to have
      grudges against their parents. This happens from time to time. If you have
      worked your way into their heart, as their friends, they most likely will
      let you know anytime there is a riff between their parents and them. They
      will not tell a leader this, they will only tell a friend.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you are opportune to be told, do not
      just let it end there. Correct them if you have to. Let them know that
      what they have done is bad. Insist they apologize to their parents. If you
      know their parents, you can apologize on their behalf. If you don’t, you
      can ask for their number and call them to tender an apology. This will
      make the parents trust you the more, knowing fully well that their youths
      are in safe hands.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Peradventure the parents are wrong, you
      will still have to device a way of talking to them maturely, and to let
      them know that things have changed from the way they were in their
      generation.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Once you begin to meddle into family
      matters like this, it shows your influence is crossing generational
      borders. The parents will no longer see you as their son’s or daughter’s
      leader, but a family friend whom they can confide in. And once in a while,
      they may call you to come speak with your ‘boy’ or your ‘girl’. This is a
      great honor to any leader who understands it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>CELEBRATE WITH THEM</b><br>
      Remember the special days in their lives and celebrate with them on such
      days. Days like their birthdays should constantly be remembered. If you
      find it difficult remembering these days, mark them on your office
      calendar or cell phone reminder.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you can, get them a gift on their
      birthday. No matter how small, it will be appreciated. If you cannot get a
      gift, at least, make a call or send a text to wish them a great day.
      Matriculation day, Convocation day, First day at work, Wedding day and the
      like are all very special days in the lives of your youths. Make these
      really special for them by adding some colors to them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>MEET THEIR NEEDS</b><br>
      The youth ministry is capital intensive. As a youth leader, be prepared to
      spend money.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Youths have many needs. As discussed
      earlier, one major need is finance. You must be ready to meet their needs
      as the Lord blesses you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Their financial problem should become your
      financial problem. Those who have challenges at home and who now see you
      as a friend, will confide in you. They necessarily may not expect that you
      should foot all of their bills. They just want to confide in a friend.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> However, if you can afford it, as much as
      the Lord blesses you, meet their needs. If you do, the good Lord will
      reward your labor of love, and the youths will not forget that you were
      right by them when they needed a pillar to lean on</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>BE INTERESTED IN THEIR LOVE LIFE</b><br>
      Show genuine interest in their love life and their sexual relationships.
      In this age where most students do not graduate from school before age
      twenty two, most of them get hooked up in a serious relationship before
      leaving school.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The likelihood is that some of your
      followers are engaged, whether you believe it or not. Most of them may
      still be considered too young to go into such relationships, but peer
      pressure could make a youth do what he really does not want to do.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Whether or not you are engaged, it becomes
      important that you are genuinely interested in the relationships of those
      who are honorably engaged in the group you lead! Ask how they are coping,
      and if needed, give a word of advice every now and then. The reason is
      simple: if a youth, male or female is emotionally imbalanced, it will
      affect every other area of his life, including his participation in your
      youth group. So, be interested in their affairs.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> You will also need to show your interest in
      the love life of those who are not yet engaged, although you will need to
      be cautious and diplomatic about this if you are not yet engaged yourself,
      else you will be sending out a wrong signal.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If any one of them is old enough to be in a
      relationship and is not yet in any, show you care by asking why he is not
      yet in a relationship. Advise him relatively, but please be matured about
      it; respect their opinions.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="settings">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">If they are not yet old enough to be in a
      relationship, encourage them to focus more on their academics in order to
      build a strong foundation for the future. Teach the females the tricks
      which male students are likely to use to get them hooked in unprofitable
      relationships and how to avoid them. Teach the males to live sexually
      chaste lives in a sexually corrupt world.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>SCHEDULE INTERESTING
        ACTIVITIES</b><br>
      From time to time, schedule interesting activities. The activities could
      either be spiritual or social, with a spiritual undertone.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> You can organize games or sports
      competition, among them, musical concerts, film shows, love feasts, guest
      days, excursions, field trips, visitation to the beach, museum, or zoo.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> These programs always appeal to the hearts
      of young people and will keep their interest.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>CHOOSE COMPETENT WORKFORCE</b><br>
      It is your responsibility to choose who you want to work with. Take your
      time to creatively choose a competent workforce.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Screen your followers and pick the best
      that you can conveniently work with and who will not pose any threat to
      your leadership. This factor is discussed in detail in a later chapter
      because of its importance.</p>
    <h2> ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR A YOUTH PASTOR/MINISTER</h2>
    <h2> DISCOVER THEIR DESTINY IN CHRIST</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you pastor a youth church, it will be
      your responsibility to help each youth discover his destiny in Christ. Let
      them not remain babes for too long; help them to grow spiritually. Help
      them to discover their spiritual gifts, their talents, and their callings.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> No one prays to have a child with stunted
      growth. If you lead them for a whole year, and there is no visible
      spiritual growth in their lives, it means you have not been doing what you
      should do. Each year must welcome a new level of spiritual progress in the
      lives of your youth. This is when you can call yourself a youth minister.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>ENCOURAGE THEM TO PRACTISE THEIR FAITH</b><br>
      It is also your primary responsibility to encourage them to practice their
      faith, especially when they are outside the church environment or in the
      midst of their friends.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This is one thing that is so difficult for
      youths to do. They want to live like the world. Your constant
      encouragement will make it easy for them to live to please the Lord
      anywhere they find themselves.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>BE CREATIVE IN YOUR DELIVERY</b><br>
      To break through the ear - bursting noise of this age’s social networking
      and peer pressure with a scripturally balanced life-giving message will
      require some commitment on the youth pastor’s part. You will need to be
      creative in your delivery of the word.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Youths are exciting in nature and are not
      used to boring moments. Adults may endure a cold sermon because of their
      maturity, but youths want it lively. So bring in illustrations that will
      make your messages more relevant to their generation.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Present the word in a manner they can
      relate with. Apply each of your messages to their daily lives, teaching
      them how to apply Christian principles to their everyday experiences and
      to make a difference in the world. Do not just preach doctrines or
      controversial issues. Your messages must provide for them a visible and
      workable alternative to the world’s suggestions. If not, you will lose
      them to the world.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The world today is constantly bombarding
      the mind of today’s youths with the message that runs counterclockwise to
      the teachings of the scriptures. Messages of immorality, violence and
      reckless living are preached to them with all zeal. In order for us not to
      lose them to the devil’s altar call, your messages must have an answer to
      the silent questions of their heart.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>PRAY WITH THEM</b><br>
      As a youth minister, it is also required of you to pray with them from
      time to time, especially during their moments of trials, temptations,
      persecutions, examinations and difficulties.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Pray with them whenever they are around you
      and let them feel the impact of your prayers even when they are far away
      from you. Let them be able to boast confidently, even when they are not
      around you: “I know my pastor is praying for me”.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Beside praying with them, encourage them to
      also pray with one another. This will help to divert their attention away
      from focusing on their own needs alone, to finding a means of helping
      others.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>ORGANISE OUTREACH PROGRAMS</b><br>
      Your programs should not be targeted at building the members of the youth
      church alone. You should organize programs that will reach out to the
      youth in the neighboring communities of your local church.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This will help them to partake in the
      greatest assignment Jesus Christ gave to the church – The Great
      Commission. Such outreach programs done from time to time will result in
      an explosion of the church, in no time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>LIVE A MODEL LIFE</b><br>
      As much as you preach balanced scripture, also live a balanced life. Do
      what you preach. Do not live a double standard life. Be an exemplary
      leader.<br>
      Try as much as possible to live the life you preach so that you will not
      lose your credibility with your followers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>ENCOURAGE ADULT VOLUNTEERS</b><br>
      You will need volunteers to work with you. It is your duty as a youth
      pastor to encourage adult volunteers from the main church to join you in
      modeling the youths.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This will alleviate the pressure of the
      work on you, both financially and other wise. In addition to the reduction
      in pressure, the youths will also have a number of role models and mentors
      beside you, there by giving them a wide range of exposures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>SPECIAL NEWSLETTER</b><br>
      Organize for them a special take home newsletter. This newsletter will
      contain things like upcoming events of the church, special celebrants
      list, relevant articles to build their faith, games and puzzles.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This will keep them busy all through the
      week.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>CONCLUSION</b><br>
      These and many more will facilitate a healthy relationship between you and
      them, and a healthy relationship with them will result in more support
      from them. If need be, make phone calls, write unsolicited notes of
      encouragement, visit them once in a while send e-mails and text messages.
      The texts &amp; mails do not always have to be personalized for each of
      them in case there is no such time (if there is enough time there is no
      harm in that, it’s the best). Do not be too busy replying mails, answering
      calls and scheduling appointments such that you will not have time to run
      with your goals and aspirations. Balance it up.</p>
