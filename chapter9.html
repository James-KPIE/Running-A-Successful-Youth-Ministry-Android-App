    <h2 style="text-align: center;">HANDLING CRITICISMS</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you really intend to be a great leader,
      prepare ahead for confrontations, attacks, criticisms and the like, for
      they will surely come. Diligence in leadership does not make you free from
      being critiqued. No matter how diligent and committed you are, still
      expect that some particular group of your followers will criticize some of
      your actions.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To conclude that everyone will accept you
      because you have done enough good for your organization is a costly
      assumption. Every leader, (and in fact everyone) who has ever dared to
      break into uncharted waters has faced criticisms, new problems and new
      challenges, but only the few who persevered ended up victorious.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is nothing you do under heaven that
      can free you from criticism. You only learn to survive it. Criticism goes
      with leadership. Every leader, good or bad will be criticized. Why? This
      is because you simply cannot please everyone! What some will criticize you
      for, others will celebrate you for the same. What some will like about
      you, others will hate about you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">That is life for you. Not everyone will like
      your face, or your guts, or your ideas, or your accomplishments. This may
      sound unrealistic, but it is the truth. So, expect it. It is inevitable.
      Some of those criticisms may even come for reasons that may have little or
      nothing to do with you personally or your leadership. Accept them in good
      faith.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In the real sense of it, as stones are
      thrown at only fruit-bearings trees, criticism comes mainly to the
      efficient leaders. If you are a functional leader, do not be scared of it.
      A load of criticism will be constantly dumped on your personality, ego and
      projects. You will receive more attacks than your colleagues who are not
      half as committed as you are. Your achievements and the records you have
      laid will attract a lot of it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Accept this fact early enough! Not every
      student will like you or your leadership style. No leader in history ever
      succeeded in having 100% followership. Even Jesus, the greatest man that</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">ever lived, had his enemies. It is natural
      that some youths fall headlong for you while some kick against every one
      of your moves. Jesus, as good as he was, and still is, had enough people
      who kicked against his leadership style, but this did not deter him.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Leaders who are afraid of criticism do not
      achieve much. Take a stand for the truth, critic or no critic. That some
      are against your leadership style and criticize every one of your action
      does not mean you have failed as a leader, neither does it mean you have
      to change your approach to leadership, especially when it is obvious you
      are on the right path. You cannot please everyone. The only likely way to
      avoid criticism is to attempt nothing and just maintain the status quo,
      but even at that, some people will still complain of your inactions!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The critics can choose any method of
      approach they deem fit. The bold ones may approach you face to face, while
      the cautious ones may try to avoid a direct contact with you and prefer to
      call, text, mail, or write. The very bad ones will go behind you telling
      tales around.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">TYPES OF CRITICS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At times, criticism may seem to come at you
      from all sides, and sometimes, as ridiculous as it may sound, these
      criticisms will always come (1) from the least expected sources, (2) at
      the least expected time, and (3) it will be about the least expected
      issues. If not, you will not be so bothered about them. This is why you
      need to try as much as possible to live your life above reproach.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not be over-dependent on people. If you
      do, someday, someone will let you down. Expect disappointment from</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">anyone. Those you think will always be there
      for you may be the first to turn their backs on you.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Do not fully base your morale each time on
      people’s approval of your activities only. If you seek to please everyone
      every time, for fear of attack or rejection, you will soon get into
      problems with everyone. Most times, you will have to take a rigid stand
      and make up your mind to do what is right. Let your critics say or do
      whatever they like, as long as you are doing what is expected of you, the
      end result will justify your means.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are two classes of critics you will
      find among your people:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The first are those who assess your
      performance and encourage you to continue by showing you areas in which
      you need to put in more effort. These ones are calm and inviting. Their
      words may be tough on you, but their intention is to see you become a
      better leader. Some of them may even be violent about it. Look beyond
      their action to their argument, and you will discover that what they lack
      is just a comfortable way of presenting their arguments; they are still on
      your side. These ones are called constructive critics.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The second are those who really do not have
      to assess you before they conclude that you are not fit to be the leader.
      Even when they have to necessarily carry out an official evaluation of
      your performance, their result is always biased, since all they want is to
      discredit your administration. These ones are always very violent, their
      arguments lopsided, and their conclusions destructive to both your
      personality and your leadership. You really need to know how to handle
      them or they may cause</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">catastrophic shake-ups in the group in order
      to destabilize things for you. These ones are called destructive critics.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Be careful! Do not make the mistake of
      taking the first for the second. Learn how to differentiate the
      constructive ones from the destructive ones. The difference is not always
      in their manner of approach, but in their end point. One is to see you
      become a better leader; the other is to make sure you are disgraced out of
      office.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">APPRECIATE YOUR CRITICS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not be hasty in dismissing the
      allegations of your critics. Whether the first or the second group, never
      ignore criticism when you are wrong, and never fight it when you are
      right. Maintain a matured leader’s attitude.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">View your critics as your friends and not
      your enemies. Take each criticism seriously. An honest evaluation of their
      criticism will show you the degree of attention you need to give to some
      of the issues they are bothered about.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are two types of friendship you will
      have among your followers: (1) The sheep in wolves’ clothing and (2) The
      wolves in sheep clothing. You will agree the former is better than the
      latter; and that’s the group where your critics fall.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In a sense, you should show sincere
      appreciation to those who criticize you openly, whether constructively or
      destructively. Some of the people you trust say worse things in your
      absence and smile in your presence. These are wolves in sheep clothing.
      So, do not take any serious offence in those who criticize you often, they
      may not know it, but they are doing you the favor</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">which most of your friends and fans will not
      do – opening your eyes to your shortcomings. Somehow, we may call them the
      sheep in wolves clothing.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your best teachers are your destructive
      critics if you know how to learn from them. They will paint you the way
      you really are or worse. They may, most times, overemphasize some details
      to their own advantage, but you can be sure they are saying some salient
      truths, most of which some of your intimate friends will hide from you
      intentionally, probably so as not to embitter or derail you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is not to say all criticisms are right;
      but it is more dangerous to conclude all are wrong.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">HOW TO MINIMIZE CRITICISMS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Critiques cannot be completely eliminated.
      You will always have them around you. However, you can silence them or
      make them irrelevant by taking some conscious steps. These steps are
      explained below.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. CRITICISE YOURSELF</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not wait until your critiques spur you
      into action before you get into action. In order to minimize criticisms
      from others, first criticize yourself by all standards.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do a constant self-evaluation.
      Self-criticisms prevent public criticisms. If you can genuinely assess
      your own processes and performances frankly and justly, and you are
      willing to make amendments where necessary, you will leave little or
      nothing for your critiques to talk about.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Criticism is the rod with which God
      chastises and corrects erring leaders. You either allow Him to correct you
      using your own hands through self-criticism, or let him go through your
      followers using open criticism. You can be sure one is better than the
      other.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. ENCOURAGE POSITIVE CRITICISMS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Intentionally invite criticisms. Encourage
      the contribution of your people in the assessment of your performance. If
      you have taken the previous step, which is self-evaluation, you will have
      nothing to fear asking for their assessment.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Let them know you will appreciate
      constructive criticisms and create an avenue for them to express it. You
      may give them a phone number, an e-mail address, or place a suggestion box
      in a public place for those who care.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Also, schedule periodic Question and Answer
      sessions for people who have serious and genuine complaints. You can even
      make appointments with some of them, individually, so they can air their
      views. This way, you have beaten them to it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. DO NOT CRITICIZE OTHERS NEGATIVELY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not be a destructive critic of another.
      If your followers discover that you are fond of criticizing others, they
      will be encouraged to do the same about you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have issues with any of your
      followers, or with another leader, rather than spend reasonable time
      spreading untrue tales about the person, or condemning his activities,
      call the person aside and discuss your grievances constructively.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
											<p style="text-align: justify;">This will, in a way, save the person from
      public shame, and he will be grateful to you. It will also serve as a
      lesson to him, and numerous other onlookers. They have unconsciously
      learnt how you want to be treated if others have issues with you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a rule, if you are a leader, never spend
      your time telling tales about others. People who criticize others to you
      will criticize you to others.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">ANSWERING YOUR CRITICS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When asked questions by any of your critics,
      do not rush to give any answers. Take your time; respond slowly. Think
      through what you want to say before you open your mouth. If it is from a
      destructive critic, the questions may be a trap to get you to say what you
      should not say.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Criticisms, no matter how well meaning they
      may be, are not palatable. If you are ready for them, make up your mind to
      receive whatever they have to say in whatever package they offer it. Do
      not expect your critics to speak nice words. They are, most times, unkind
      in their choice of words. Some of them may really not intend to hurt your
      feelings, but they end up doing exactly that without knowing it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Criticism is different from insults.
      “Insults” have nothing good to say about you or your services and can be
      unreasonably abusive without listening to any explanation, but criticism,
      negative or positive, will open your eyes to your short comings. This is
      because critics have points. They assess you and your performance and
      reveal your weakness to all and the manner of presentation of their
      assessments is not always pleasant.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Although their conclusions after assessing
      you may be wrong, and they may also be right, it does not matter to them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have to answer a critic, do not
      answer when you are angry. First calm down, cool your temper, then you can
      give an answer.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Constructive or destructive, take the
      criticisms without being crushed or defeated. Never think of retaliating
      negative criticisms. Do not fire back at them. Constant encounter with
      such, mainly immature followers and their unfair criticisms may be
      frustrating. Do not get personal. Do not be defensive.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The basic intention of most of your critics
      is to hurt you. This they will do in three ways;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(1) by hurling hurtful and biting words at
      you;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(2) by spreading bad and untrue news about
      you;</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(3) by instigating you to overreact and do
      or say things you should not.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once they can successfully use the first two
      to make you do the third one, they have achieved their aims. Do not be
      moved by the tone of their words or letters. Be yourself; do not let their
      plans see the light of day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is a known fact that youths generally are
      volatile, but this statement is truer than ever today. For this reason,
      you will need to be careful in your choice of words when replying. Avoid
      being offensive in defending your points. Words have different meanings to
      different people. Some words instigate youths and make them want to foment
      trouble while other choice of words can pacify their violent spirits. Know
      when to use which.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Youths rarely appreciate good leaders when
      they see one, hence they hardly get one. If you are one, keep being good.
      Your deeds may not be appreciated now, but the end will justify the means.
      Those who have turned against you will come back to seek your favor.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Assess their criticism. Evaluate their barbs
      and gibes. If their point is justifiable, try to correct it, but if it is
      illegitimate, forget it as quick as possible.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">WHEN WILL YOU BE CRITICIZED?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Expect criticism anytime and every time your
      critics are opportune to build a case, major or minor, against you. Youths
      will use every opportunity they have to criticize your actions, especially
      if your tenure is not favorable to them. Every time your actions do not go
      down well with them, you will be opposed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Below are four major periods during which
      you cannot avoid their criticism if you are a leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. BEFORE INSTALLATION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">They will start criticizing you even before
      the installation. They will fault either the electioneering process or the
      selection technique by which you emerged the leader. They will fault the
      king makers and the members of the electoral committee for not being fair
      during the process. They are so sure you are the wrong choice. You will do
      yourself good not to listen to them. Your success during your leadership
      will prove them wrong.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. DURING INSTALLATION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some may still continue their ministry
      during the installation. They will condemn the process of installations
      because it was not done according to their expectation. They will condemn
      the program of events, condemn the organizing committee, condemn the
      speeches, condemn the officials present and condemn the leader to be
      installed. Some of them may even condemn the type of meal that was served
      at the installation ceremony when there is nothing more to condemn, as
      though the food is more important to them than the person being installed.
      All of these are none of your problem. You just face the reason why you
      are there – to be installed as the leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. AFTER INSTALLATION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not think they are through with you yet.
      They have just started. Every one of your program will be criticized. If
      you do something, you will be criticized. If you do nothing, they still
      will criticize your procrastinations. If you shout, they will say you are
      too harsh. If you are mute, they will say you are too weak. If you manage
      the purse well, they will say you are stingy. If you spend lavishly, they
      will say you are too extravagant.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Not all will approve of your style of
      leadership. Some will feel you are too sophisticated or contemporary. Some
      may even feel you are too canal, while others may feel you are too
      spiritual. Your followers will always have divergent views of your
      leadership style. Adaptability and the view will be dependent on who is
      doing the evaluation. All through the period of your tenure, expect to be
      criticized.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. AFTER THE TENURE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Now they have enough reasons to criticize
      you since you have handed the baton of power over to your successor.
      Everything you are supposed to do which you did not do will be criticized.
      The ones you are not supposed to do that you did will also be criticized.
      Even the ones you did, but by their judgment, were not well done, will
      also be criticized. They will review every one of your actions and look
      for enough proofs to convince everyone that you are the worst leader they
      ever had.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">WHO WILL CRITICIZE YOU?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You will encounter pressures from many
      fronts, most of which will combat you with the intent to destroy your good
      works. Be prepared for this.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You must readily expect insults and
      criticism from six groups of people.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="settings">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">1. YOUR OPPONENTS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your opponents will never have anything good
      to say about you. They want you out of the office so they can take charge
      by planting their own candidate there, and they will use every possible
      means to achieve their goal.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">They really are not interested in your good
      works, it matters little to them. What they pray for and are on the
      lookout for is that you commit blunders so they can nail you and kick you
      out.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So, whatever insult or criticism you receive
      from them, handle same with utmost care. Do not try to buy them over, or
      try to win them to yourself; it may work for some of them for a while but
      not all of them at every time. Just be on your own and face</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">your official duty with a clean plate such
      that they will have no hold on you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you give them a chance to get at you, you
      are a goner!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. YOUR WORK FORCE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You will be shocked to hear this! Your work
      force, who should be the most supportive, will have enough reasons to
      criticize you once in a while. Do not be disappointed. The purpose of
      their criticism is different; it is, most times, not intended to pull you
      down. It is to see you become a better leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So, you must desire to hear more of their
      criticisms. The concern of your work force is legitimate since your
      success is their success. So, do not be intimidated by their constant
      constructive criticisms. The earlier you sit down, examine their
      criticisms and differentiate them from others, the more of these you will
      want.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">None of them is going to overthrow your
      leadership. If you truly gained their allegiance and trust as soon as you
      entered the office, without stepping on their toes, they will not turn
      their backs on you. So, take their criticism as precious words of advice.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. FELLOW LEADERS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">New levels attract new devils and fresh
      oppositions come with new position. One of the oppositions you will face
      will come from other leaders. You are not the only leader in your church
      or around the neighborhood. There are several other leaders leading other
      segments, units, hostels, departments, faculties and fellowships.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your commitment to your leadership
      responsibilities and your uncommon achievements may begin to generate
      jealousy among them. If you are really doing what is expected of you as
      much as you are supposed to, you are bound to be hated, because your
      commitment to your tasks will make it obvious that some of the others are
      really not doing as much as is expected of them. Your achievements
      compared to theirs will serve as a proof of this.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once other followers begin to compare their
      leaders’ achievements to yours, they begin to notice the flaws in their
      leaders and then begin to condemn them. This will definitely make the
      other leaders around hate you. Since they cannot remove you of their own
      accord, they will begin to criticize you. They will criticize every one of
      your actions so as to get back at you. This is a battle every leader must
      learn to fight!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. INTIMATE FRIENDS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your intimate friends too will criticize
      you. The friends you had before getting to the leadership position still
      expect to have as much access to you now as they had then. They still want
      to have as much hold on you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">They may want to direct you and push you
      around because of the familiarity. If you must carry out your duties
      successfully, such should not be encouraged. They still remain your
      friends, but they must be made to understand that official matters are not
      supposed to be sacrificed on the altar of acquaintance.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is where the problem lies. Most of them
      will not want to see it this way. They will immediately conclude that you
      are now proud, and then start to criticize all of your actions.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike others, these ones are easy to deal
      with. Simply call their attention to the obvious, they will understand and
      let you be.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You really do not have to please everyone
      because you definitely cannot. The easiest way to encounter failure as a
      leader is by trying to please everybody. Let such friends know you cannot
      always dance to their tunes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. YOUR FOLLOWERS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Beside your opponents and fellow leaders,
      the strongest of the criticism you will experience will come from your
      followers. Do not expect every youth around to praise you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Irrespective of how much you have achieved,
      it is possible that most will not appreciate whatever you have done. Some
      honestly will; but most will be too unwilling to give credit to you for
      your achievements. That is youths for you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Youths are the most difficult people to
      lead. They are not too easy to please, and the reason is simply because
      they rarely own their own thought. They do not reason with their own
      minds. They act on someone else’s thought and reasoning. They move and
      react on someone else’s orders.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When a majority leader says you are good,
      they start to praise you. The day he decides to turn his back on you; they
      all start to condemn your actions. They are like the Jews who hailed Jesus
      on a Sunday morning saying “Hosanna to the son of David. Blessed is He
      that cometh in the name of the Lord” but the following Friday screamed
      “Crucify Him”.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As difficult as it looks, these ones are
      easy to handle. Since their criticism is as a result of misconception of
      your actions, you only need to sponsor a silent campaign that will address
      the issue. This way, you will be able to silent the opposition who is
      sponsoring the crisis.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">6. THE HIGHER AUTHORITY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The last group you will receive criticism
      from is the higher authority; but this will only happen if you are not
      doing the right thing. If you are on the right path, you seldom will have
      any problem with them. The higher authority will include the leader of the
      mother church, the school authority, and the other leaders around to whom
      you are answerable.</p>
