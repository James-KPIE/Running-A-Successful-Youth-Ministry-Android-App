    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <h2>BASIC NEEDS OF THE YOUTHS</h2>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A leader is simply defined as someone who
      has followers. He wields a measure of influence, either formal or
      informal, on some set of people. He is in charge of directing, guiding,
      steering, advising, and counseling those whom he leads. Whether he is an
      expert at it or not, he is held responsible for every decision taken
      within the group, and he also receives praise for every good action.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A youth leader is not much
      different from other leaders. The only difference is that his followers
      are mainly youths. He may still be within the age bracket of a youth, or a
      little older, but his leadership influence is exerted solely among people
      who are still youthful in age, and not just young at heart. It could be in
      the church, in the neighborhood, within the campus community, among
      classmates, schoolmates, roommates, or fellowship mates, all of whom are
      within the same age bracket.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In the light of the understanding of the
      basic needs of a youth, a youth leader is basically the one who meets
      these needs in their lives. He may not necessarily be called the youth
      leader; whatever nomenclature he is given, as long as he has influence on
      some youths, whatever their number, he is a youth leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The very common terminologies are: the
      Students Union Executives, Campus Fellowship Leaders, Singles
      Coordinators, or Youth Directors/Minister/Pastors. In this book, all of
      these are hereafter referred to as Youth Leaders.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever name you are called, every youth
      leader must know this: Much depends on you, the leader. You get the credit
      if things go well and also the condemnation if things fall out of balance.
      This is why you need to, constantly, avail yourself of materials that will
      make leading easy and convenient for you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are two types of leaders:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1) Positional Leaders: These are individuals
      who are called leaders by virtue of the positions of authority which they
      occupy. They command followership because of the title or post they have,
      and not necessarily by the functions they perform.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2) Functional Leaders: These may not
      necessarily hold any position of authority, but by virtue of the functions
      which they naturally perform, they command respect from the followers
      because of the guidance and instructions which they provide from time to
      time. Some of them always end up elected/appointed as Positional Leaders
      because of the large followership they command.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Whichever of the two categories an
      individual finds himself in, he should know that the major function of a
      leader is to influence others positively to attain a specified desired
      goal. This main function of a leader can be further broken into two
      divisions. Irrespective of who he is leading, once he can render</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">these two services to his followers, he is
      qualified to be called a good leader:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> 1. To teach his followers how
      easy it is to do the right thing, and do all in his power to convince (but
      not force) them to it.<br>
      2. To teach his followers the consequences of doing what is wrong and make
      it difficult for them to do it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Wherever you find yourself being a leader,
      or whoever you have been called to lead, do not forget these dual roles of
      a leader. Any leader who can successfully combine these two services is a
      good leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Good leadership is by choice. Every leader
      ends up being the kind of leader he desires to be. Every good leader is a
      good leader because he has decided within him to be one. The same goes for
      a bad leader. No one becomes a bad leader by chance. It is by choice too.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> One basic way to identify a good leader is
      that he illuminates the way so that his followers can see their paths and
      follow his leadings. A good leader leads people towards their goals and
      purposes in life while a bad leader leads people further away from them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>IMPROMPTU LEADERS</b><br>
      The greatest of leaders were not born leaders. They were self made. Not
      all the people we admire today as role models started off with the
      intention to become great leaders. Most of them were just living their own
      lives and doing their own thing in their unique ways, and men found out
      that they possessed great ability to influence the destinies of other men
      and the capability of harmonizing the un-corrugated efforts of both the
      willing and the non-willing followers for the common good of their
      immediate environment. So the leadership mantle fell on them. If this is
      what happened to you, then you need not be scared. You also can become the
      best of leaders around. Although not dominant, but inherent in you is a
      great leadership ability which has been discovered by those who nominated
      you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This may not happen too often, but it is
      possible you are honestly made a leader among a group you know nothing
      about. This is no crime. It becomes your personal responsibility to
      develop yourself and your leadership ability to a state where everyone
      will accept your leadership and respect your views and opinions on all
      related matters. This will not happen until you have taken time to
      seriously work on yourself.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> “Luck” may bring you an opportunity, but
      only “skill” will turn the opportunity into success. If luck has brought
      the opportunity to lead along your path in life, it has done you more good
      than harm. It is left to you to make a choice whether or not to make a
      success of the opportunity presented to you by sharpening your skill.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Most youth leaders do not read books on
      leadership; they think it is too early. They feel they can still manage to
      lead their followers with the little experience they have, since they are
      youths and not adults. This is not ideal.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Whatever quality you, the youth leader,
      learn today, it will still be useful to you years later when you become a
      more matured</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
											<p style="text-align: justify;">leader. It will do you a lot of good if you
      can learn all you need to learn, today, about leadership.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Leadership is not all about age. If you
      have what it takes, gray haired men will submit to you of their own
      accord. If you develop your leadership quality, you will be surprised that
      some people will notice it and may invite you to lead a more mature
      audience, even while you are still in your youth.</p>
    <h2> THE THREE BASIC NEEDS OF THE YOUTHS</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If the youth ministry is fundamentally to
      meet the needs of the youth, the question now is, what are the basic needs
      of a youth?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>1. EMOTIONAL NEEDS</b><br>
      Just like every other person, youths are emotional beings, and their
      number one need is for someone who can meet their emotional needs.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>A) Youths need to be loved</b><br>
      Most times, people do not show enough love to them. Elders are quick to
      judge and condemn them without seeking to understand their own views about
      issues. They need someone who will relate to them in love and not one who
      will treat them harshly. Even if they are wrong, they expect the elders to
      offer advice in love, correct in love, and if need be, chastise in love.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This is why they are easily swayed by
      members of the opposite sex who claim to love them (but may really not
      mean it), and they do all that is possible to keep their distance from
      their own people who actually love them and have their best interest at
      heart but do not show it. Youths need to be loved.<br>
      B) Youths need care, affection and attention<br>
      Most adults tend to think that since youths are grownups and are almost
      about the same height as their parents, they should naturally behave
      maturely. We easily forget that, irrespective of their heights, they are
      not yet adults, they are still youths. Maturity does not come with height
      but with the experiences of life which one has gone through.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Some of these youths have not had the
      needed experience to make them really mature. Most of the things their
      generations know are from the social media, internet, films and friends.
      They still need to be cared for and tendered like a growing plant. No
      farmer stops watering his seed because it has sprouted from the ground.
      The watering and tendering continue until the plant either starts bearing
      fruits or is able to stand alone. The youths also should be shown every
      necessary care and attention until they attain child bearing age or when
      they can stand alone as adults.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>C) Youths need confidants and friends</b><br>
      Youths need confidants. They need counselors who they can confide in. They
      need people who can relate to whatever they are passing through, and
      rather than paint them as black goats, help them out of every unthinkable
      situation which they put themselves in, and put them back on the right
      track without revealing their secrets at the top of the mountains.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>2. MATERIAL NEEDS</b><br>
      The second basic need of youths is material.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>A) Financial Needs</b><br>
      Youths need money. If you ask them, they even think that they need money
      much more than the adults, and they do not hide this fact. They need to
      look good, dress well, buy good phones, recharge their phones, and do a
      whole lot of things that only money can do but their parents will not give
      them money to!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This financial need of the youth is so
      important that every church that wants to maximize their usefulness in the
      church must begin to teach them how to be financially independent.
      Organize conferences and seminars that will teach them how to make money
      so as to meet their financial needs so that they will not become a burden
      to others. If the church refuses to teach them, someone else will; and
      whoever does, they may eventually follow, whether right or wrong.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>B) Success</b><br>
      Much more than anything, youths desire to be successful in life. This is
      more like their most paramount need. Their definition of success is
      different from the scriptural definition of success which is, simply, to
      fulfill destiny.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Their own definition of success is, most
      times, material; drive big cars, build big houses, run big companies, have
      big titles, and just make it in life in a big way. This is what success
      means to them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Although this definition of success may not
      be completely right, but as long as what they desire is not against the
      scripture, teach them how to get this desire. Empower them to be
      successful. Get professionals in every area of life to speak to them, from
      time to time. You will be surprised at the result over time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Much more than this, you can go an extra
      mile to correct their definition of success. Let them know that success is
      simply fulfilling destinies. Once they can achieve their purpose of coming
      to the surface of earth, God sees them as successful, irrespective of how
      man sees them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>3. SPIRITUAL NEEDS</b><br>
      The last basic need of the youth is spiritual. You will really think that
      this should be their number one need, and you are indeed right, but the
      youths actually think otherwise. Their orientation is totally different
      from yours. They feel that the society respects a spiritual man more when
      he has accomplishments, than when he is still struggling to make headway
      in life. Most churches and ministries major on their spiritual needs
      alone. As much as this is important, the other areas of their lives should
      be taken care of too.</p>
