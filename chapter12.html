										<p style="text-align: center;">Chapter Twelve</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">WHAT MOTIVATES YOUR ACTION</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">On a careful check, you will discover that
      the list you compiled in the previous chapter which consists of the
      projects you want to accomplish during your administration is motivated by
      one of four factors. Every leader is motivated by these factors. Whichever
      of them motivates your actions will determine how successful you will
      be.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">EGO MOTIVATED</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So many leaders do things in order to
      satisfy their ego. They consult nobody. They get ideas, advice, and
      counsel from nobody. They just take their decisions based on whatever
      little information is available to them and they expect others to follow
      blindly, whether they agree with their decisions or not. These are power
      drunk leaders.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Leadership is not all about the leader; it
      is all about the followers. It is not about what you can do for yourself
      but about what you can do for the group. If you are more concerned about
      yourself than about the people, then you are ego motivated and will not
      last as the leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Leadership is also about service. Every good
      leader should be concerned about rendering effective service to his
      followers and not just be authoritarian. If you also desire to be a good
      leader, you must aspire to be a servant-leader and not a dominating
      leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A good leader, though firm, is not rigid.
      Rigid authoritarians, also known as bosses, show the way and compel others
      to go the way. No one confronts them; they are egocentric. However, firm
      authoritative leaders show the way, lead the way, and convince others to
      follow.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are lots of differences between being
      authoritative and being authoritarian. To be authoritarian is to be
      dominating, harsh, oppressive, dictatorial and tyrannical. To be
      authoritative is to be directional and supervisory. As a leader, there
      will always be an uncontrollable urge to dominate your follower, but this
      should be continually put under check.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not lust after prominence and power; else
      you will be so obsessed by it that you will comfortably climb on anyone at
      will to get it.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">MASSES MOTIVATED</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A mass-motivated leader is one who does not
      have his own mind or rarely uses it. He dances to every tune played by the
      masses. He really cannot stamp his feet if he needs to, and he cannot
      convince his followers to do the right thing. Rather than govern, he is
      governed. He easily caves in to wrong doing when pressured by the crowd.
      He is scared of everything. He is scared of losing power; scared of losing
      his position; scared of losing the people; scared of losing anything or
      everything. He is a fear-filled ruler.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a mass-motivated leader, you will
      need to change your ways if you must lead rightly. Learn to do the right
      thing; regardless of what others think. If you are in the habit of
      allowing your followers manipulate you, you are not the leader they need.
      There will always be a strong pressure on you from some of the youths to
      do what is popular rather than what is right. Do not compromise your
      stand. Use your mind.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Never embark on any project for fear of
      rejection or criticism, especially when it is not the right action to
      take. Only do what you are supposed to do. If you carry out projects
      purposely to please some sets of people, it means you are being
      manipulated by some of your followers to the detriment of the rest, and
      the end result may not be too pleasant if they get to know of this. Do
      only what you have to do.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Know how to say no when you have to. One of
      the most difficult things for people in authority to do is to say no to
      what the majority of the people want. However, if what the people want is
      not what they need, rather than say yes to all of their biddings, take
      your time to educate them and let them see the potential danger in what
      they desire. Then, give them a better alternative to what they want.
      Youths, though difficult to lead, are very reasonable followers. Once you
      can make them see reason, majority of your followers will be convinced of
      your actions. If you have been a good leader before now, and you have been
      able to gain their trust from the beginning of your tenure, they will
      trust your judgment and follow the path of your “better” alternative.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Jesus disappointed all His followers who
      thought they could manipulate Him because of their intimacy with Him. The
      two sons of Zebedee wanted the two seats on His right and left side in His
      kingdom, but they were disappointed. They even brought their mother to
      plead on their behalf but Jesus turned deaf hears to them. Peter, as close
      as he was to Jesus, was going to stop Him from going to Jerusalem. He also
      was embarrassed. There were many other instances where Jesus’ close pals
      thought they could control Him at will, but He never allowed Himself to be
      manipulated.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Learn from Jesus. Never follow the masses
      when they are wrong. Lead your followers to do the right thing.</p>

                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										 <p style="text-align: justify;">DREAM MOTIVATED</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A dream-motivated ruler is one who is only
      interested in building a name for himself and will stop at nothing to
      achieve this selfish goal. He is more interested in projects than in
      people.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">He embarks on gigantic projects that are
      beyond the capacity of both himself and his followers, and then drives his
      followers crazy to get the projects accomplished, without caring a bit
      about how they feel. He goes from one major project to another, using the
      people as mere tools to get his projects accomplished and his ambitions
      achieved. He selfishly focuses more on his projects to the detriment of
      his people, and finds it easier to use people than to grow them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is not fair. A good leader should focus
      on both, but more on the people. Rather than drive your people heartlessly
      to build your projects, a good leader will spend more of his time and
      resources building the people, knowing fully well that, after they are
      well established, the people he has built will support him in building
      laudable projects. Great leaders build the people who, in turn, build the
      projects.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Be more interested in the people than in
      your dreams and projects. The people should be your first target. If the
      people can fall in love with you, they will buy into your projects and you
      will not need to force them to carry them on. They will willingly, even
      beyond what you expect.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are one of the leaders who use people
      only to accomplish their goals, you will make undue demands on them that
      will wear them out. This may result in discouragement and fatigue, and you
      may end up losing the people, and thereafter, the project. Irrespective of
      the importance of the projects, if your followers are heavily worn out and
      unreasonably spent as at the time of accomplishment, you are not a good
      leader. Their enthusiasm must be maintained from the beginning to the end
      of</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">the project. It is by such action only that
      you gain their unflinching allegiance to you and the remaining projects.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Never place the project ahead of the people.
      The purpose of your projects should be to meet people’s needs. Any project
      that does not meet this first criterion is a wild dream. You do not have
      to receive any direct benefit from all of your projects. That should not
      be the purpose. If that is your singular purpose, you are a selfish
      dream-motivated leader. If all you care about is your pocket, your
      benefits, your name, and what comes to you, you are not an ideal leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The first four letters in the word ‘leader’
      is spelt LEAD. Good leaders lead their followers, and their followers are
      always willing to follow. If you are a leader and the majority of your
      followers complain about your leadership style, or revolt and rebel, not
      desiring to follow, then something is wrong. The problem may be that you
      are more of a dream motivated leader. Good leaders do not lord their
      dreams and projects over others.</p>

										<p style="text-align: justify;">If your intention is to make use of the
      youths for the sole purpose of furthering your own hidden agenda, trouble
      looms. Do not just use them as a means to achieve your goals. They are
      humans, not robots. Devote more of your time and energy to people than to
      projects. The projects you build will someday be forgotten, but the people
      you build will forever remember you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">NEED MOTIVATED</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These are the leaders who build their
      projects around their followers’ needs.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If your leadership role cannot solve the
      problem of the youths you are leading, you have no business being their
      leader. Great leaders are more particular about their followers’ needs.
      Until you know the need of the people and you are ready to meet it, you
      cannot make progress as a leader. It is the problem you solve that
      determines the name you earn.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Watch out for keenly felt needs and think of
      innovative and creative ways to solve them. These can make your influence
      in leadership grow steadily and rapidly. Committed leaders need not force
      other people to go along with them; they natural follow, simply because
      they are sensitive to the paramount desires of their followers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once your followers discover that you are a
      good leader with wonderful ideas, good programs and relevant projects,
      they celebrate you as one of the best leaders they ever had, and will,
      likely, follow you sheepishly thereafter because you have won their love.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some followers may want to take advantage of
      your good nature and demand for things beyond your control. It will be
      stupid to dance to their tune. Know your limits. You are neither God, nor
      a magician. You are not a miracle worker. You are simply a leader.
      Irrespective of the quarters from where the pressure may come from, resist
      the temptation to take responsibility for things you cannot control.
      Trying to please such people will only bring you frustration since what
      they are demanding for is beyond your position and your power. Unrealistic
      goals will always result in unnecessary disappointments.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">CONCLUSION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What motivates you to do the things you want
      to do? Are you dream-motivated, masses-motivated, ego-motivated, or
      need-motivated?</p>
