										<p style="text-align: center;">Chapter Two</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">RESPONSIBILITIES OF A YOUTH LEADER (1)</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once you are appointed a youth minister or a
      student leader, your first action should be to know what is required of
      you. Leadership is responsibility. It is not enough to carry titles and
      just sit in offices. You need to know what your duties entail. This is
      what is called job description, in some quarters.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Each title in any standard establishment has
      its own job description. The essence is to help one to know precisely what
      duties are assigned to him, what other responsibilities are expected of
      him in that office and to avoid clash of duties and responsibilities with
      other personnel. Your leadership office also has some job specifications
      attached to it which may not coincide with any other person’s. Neglect of
      such leadership functions will portray you as a leader who is not worth
      his title.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The assessment of your success as a leader
      will be based on the impact you make on the lives of your followers.
      Whether you leave them better or worse than when you met them will be the
      question. If you perform your responsibilities well as a leader, your
      followers will be the better for it; if you do not, it will also tell on
      them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What improvement did you bring into their
      lives as individuals and into the assembly in general? What fresh
      opportunities did you introduce them to? If none, they may be quiet about
      it during your regime; but trust youths: when your tenure is over, you
      will hear the true assessment of your regime.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every leader should be concerned about this
      main question - What will people say about me at the end of my regime?
      Whatever they will say at the end of your tenure, good or bad, will depend
      largely on how much you have impacted their lives during the course of
      your leadership.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Leadership is more of impact on a group of
      followers and not a force that drives the people. What influence do you
      have over your people? Have you influenced their lives positively since
      you became their leader? This is one of the factors that will determine
      your acceptability.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Discussed below are three of your major
      responsibilities to your followers -</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(1) DISCOVER THEIR POTENTIALS</b><br>
      Do your best to discover the potentials in each of your followers.
      Everyone may not be gifted in all things but everyone is gifted in, at
      least one thing. If you take your time to investigate, you will discover
      that, most often than not, all the human resources you need to succeed as
      a leader are among your followers. You need no foreign expert’s help, at
      least at the initial stage. You need no mercenary from other places to aid
      you. Every human ability you need to take the group forward is in the
      lives of the people.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone has something to offer.
      Although, each of them is a separate individual with unique needs,
      concerns and desires. Beyond these challenges, every one of your followers
      has great talents, wonderful skills and enormous resources that could move
      the organization forward during your regime. Everyone has his own
      weaknesses. Rather than keep fighting them for their weaknesses, take time
      to discover their potential strength and encourage them to build on it.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">All you need, you have. All you have, you
      need. There is a wealth of potentials in the people you are called to
      lead. It may not look like it at this initial stage. Most of them have not
      and may never discover it until someone helps them to; and you are in the
      best position to do just that!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Most of the people you are called to lead
      are in a blind man’s position. With all of the abundant endowments
      of God in their lives, they still cannot see their value and
      relevance to their immediate society. They need someone to help them
      discover their latent abilities, hidden potentials, and unexplored gifts.
      This is one reason why God placed you as a leader over them; to help them
      discover their gifts and abilities.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Since most of the youths you lead will
      likely be students, you may want to assume that their lecturers will do
      this. It has been discovered overtime that lecturers do not have the time
      for personal issues like this; they are more concerned with lecturing,
      setting exam questions and marking answer scripts than having time for
      anything private with students, most of whom they have no personal
      relationship with.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Many of their friends who should help them
      with this are not interested in this either; their interest is more in
      their social life, companionship and friendship. Anything outside this is
      not important enough to be involved in.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Their parents are more occupied with
      thoughts of where to get money for the sponsorship of their education and
      catering for their general welfare and total needs, that such issues have
      become non-essentials to them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Whoever God uses as the instrument for this
      discovery will be adored by them all of their lives. Be that person.
      Discover one special thing that each person can do.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you lead quite a large group that you
      cannot personally have a direct contact with everyone, try to influence
      the few you meet on daily basis. Before you know it, one at a time, you
      would have influenced almost all. Your influence on the ones you meet per
      day will have a rippling effect on the others.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Discovering these potentials will become
      easy for you if you always look at your followers with the eyes of the
      future. Appreciate much more what they can become tomorrow than what they
      simply are today. This is the way God operates. He focuses more on
      potentials that everyone else overlooks. Be like God; discover something
      useful in everyone around you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Watch out for people in whose lives you can
      make personal investments. Determine to make the necessary investments to
      make them better. Help everyone see the good in themselves.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Lastly, recognize the latent leadership
      abilities in your followers. Some of them have leadership skills that are
      not yet discovered. Be alert to it and make use of it for the advancement
      of the group.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This is the difference between leaders who
      raise leaders and those who raise followers; the former focus on their
      strength while the latter focus on their weaknesses.</p>
	  <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(2) DEVELOP THE POTENTIALS</b><br>
      The second major duty you have as a leader is to help every one of your
      followers release the potentials you have discovered in them. This, in
      another word could be called mentoring; mentor your followers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Everyman is created to help others bring
      out the best in them. This is more paramount for a leader. Every leader
      must help his followers to become the best they are capable of becoming.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Help them to develop what you have
      discovered about them. Helping others up the ladder keeps you close to the
      top of the ladder. Teach them and train them to maturity. To succeed more
      in your office as their leader, nurture to greatness each follower’s best
      talents and abilities; they will be grateful to you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Build up your work force with all that you
      have. This may not be too easy to do. It may cost you some money. It may
      cost you some part of your personal time. To make it worse, some may not
      even be appreciative of this effort. Some may think that you are just
      being too demanding by interfering in their personal issues.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Whatever your followers think about your
      actions today, time will tell who is right. The few who are willing to
      follow your counsel and guidelines today will prove to the others tomorrow
      that you know what you are doing. Those who accuse you today will come to
      agree with you in the nearest future that you were right and that they
      were wrong.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>(3) EXPLORE THE POTENTIALS</b><br>
      After you have discovered and developed the potentials in each of your
      followers, use the developed potential for the good of<br>
      the group. So many leaders do not do this. These leaders allow developed
      talents to lie wasted until someone from outside the group discovers the
      already developed talents, hijacks the individuals, and begins to explore
      these talents. This is laxity on the part of these leaders.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Most times, these leaders blame it on the
      hijacker. They feel the hijacker did not allow the young talents to grow
      into maturity before harvesting the fruits of someone else’s labor. They
      wanted the youths in question to develop into adulthood before committing
      serious things into his hands. It is not the hijacker’s fault. He saw good
      seeds fallen carelessly on the rock, and decided to move them to fertile
      grounds, rather than allow the sun to do injustice to it. Whatever their
      excuse, they have lost an investment, and someone else is benefitting from
      it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> A good leader will be willing to help every
      follower to correctly explore their potent talents and latent potentials,
      investing these in the progress of the group. If you do not do this last
      one, then all tasks which you have done in their lives prior to this time
      will be wasted effort to you; but not to them, because someone else (who
      did not know when you were doing all the investments in them) will benefit
      from your labor.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> There are two types of leaders; those who
      develop leaders and those who develop followers. The difference between
      these two is not just what they deposit in their disciples, but how much
      of what is deposited is explored before they are left to try it out on
      their own. Almost all leaders deposit something, no matter how little, in
      their followers. Not all are willing to, patiently, wait to see their
      followers try their hands on what they have consciously or unconsciously
      learnt from them.</p>

										<p style="text-align: justify;">In order for you to be a good youth leader,
      you must transform the ordinary youths around you to influential youths by
      exploring their internal configurations. Do not just abandon them once you
      have discovered and helped them developed their talents. Give them trial
      opportunities. You will be surprised at what they will deliver.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> When you make the best use of your own
      people, you will be amazed at the super human feats you will accomplish
      through them. Train them up, then place them where their
      potentials can produce maximal results. The youths you trained today will
      carry on the baton tomorrow. Train them to maturity and watch them
      display. Give them opportunities to manifest. The major advantage of this
      is that it empowers them enough to carry on your dreams and projects with
      or without you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> After developing them to a stage, you would
      have reproduced yourself in them and spread your influence all over them,
      thereby empowering them to carry on the vision even long after your
      tenure. This way, your impact will last longer on them. You would have
      produced enough successors by training enough people who will fill the
      vacuum and carry on your legacies after you are long gone.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This is the only way to be truly successful
      as a leader; to help your followers succeed. Both parties end up with
      success stories. These are your three major responsibilities as a youth
      leader.</p>
    <h2> <b>OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES</b></h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Beside these three general responsibilities
      of all leaders stated in this chapter, there are other specific, more
      targeted responsibilities. These will be discussed in the next chapter.
      The assessment of your leadership will be based on how well you are able
      to fulfill all of these responsibilities put together. If you are new to
      the system and you do not know what some of these responsibilities may be,
      feel free to ask the following people:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>1.) YOUR PREDECESSORS</b><br>
      These ones have occupied this same position before you. Some of them have
      done wonderfully well. Others have done poorly. Hearing from these people
      will help you know what to do and what not to do. You will be able to
      build on the successes of those who succeeded and avoid the pitfalls of
      those who failed</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>2.) YOUR KINGMAKERS</b><br>
      These are the ones who are responsible for your appointment into
      leadership. They, very likely, would have given you a detailed job
      description. Whether they have or not, you may still need to meet some of
      them personally and ask them what is really expected of a fellow who
      occupies the seat you are occupying. Since they were responsible for your
      being chosen, they should be able to tell you the type of leaders they
      were sourcing for when they considered you as the best option.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>3.) YOUR FOLLOWERS</b><br>
      Some of your followers may be lucky to have survived more than one or two
      tenures of leadership in the same group. They have seen it all; the good,
      the bad and the ugly. Discussing with them about what is expected of an
      ideal leader in this group could open up a great discussion that will be
      of benefit to you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Combining the list from these three
      categories of people will give you a vivid description of the functions
      that are expected of you so that you will not be found either going beyond
      your boundary or performing below expectation. Time is too short to play
      “trial and error”. Know what you are called to do.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> However, do not be psychologically caged by
      this list. Let your imagination and creativity run wild. Only allow the
      list to guide you so that you will not fall where others before you have
      fallen.</p>
