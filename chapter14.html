    <h2 style="text-align: center;">DECISION MAKING</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One major ability you cannot run away from
      is the ability to make the right decision. Everyone makes decision; and
      thousands of them, every day: what to eat, what to say, what to</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">put on, where to go. A leader makes much
      more important decisions than these on daily basis. He makes decisions
      that not only affect his own daily life, but the destinies of thousands of
      his followers as well.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One thing that will guarantee the failure of
      any leader is if he always makes up his mind on what to do without seeking
      anybody’s opinion. Such ideas become the leader’s idea, and the project,
      his project. He will either have to push it himself alone, or impose it on
      them, and he is likely to meet with hot resistance if he decides to do the
      latter. The resistance may either be active, or passive, depending on the
      group of youths he is leading.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Henry Ford, the great inventor, did not
      remember to put a reverse gear in his first auto mobile. This sounds
      ridiculous, but it also proves that no one is a know-it-all. In making
      decisions, despite the fact that you are still the leader, you may have to
      do a lot of consultations before arriving at a final standpoint. No matter
      how brilliant your ideas look, you will still need to subject it to the
      tight scrutiny of some sort of working committee before deciding to go
      ahead with it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the greatest challenges
      facing youth leaders - decision making. There is nothing like a perfect
      idea. In order to make an idea a perfect one, it will require multiple
      touches of modifications. This is why there is need for a group
      decision-making. Always put up a team of trusted hands who will analyze
      the issues critically and help you make a quick decision that will favor
      the organization as a whole, and the individual members that build it up.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You do not have to make all the decisions.
      No single leader has all the required knowledge, the needed gifts, the
      necessary talents and the essential abilities that are mandatory for
      successful leadership. He will always need others. It is shown on the
      pages of history that men who got to leadership positions and never
      listened to other people’s advice always failed. Check around and you will
      see.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dialogue must come before decision. Dialogue
      together with those who are relevant to the decision you are about to
      take. Let everyone present contribute their own quota. Even a mad man at
      times makes sense when listened to. Listen to everybody. Examine the
      situation from every possible perspective presented. Evaluate their
      objections and criticisms.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Respect the opinion of everyone in the
      meeting, although, this will in no sense mean that every opinion must be
      accepted. It also does not mean you have to carry out every suggestion;
      you do not. However, giving everyone the opportunity to speak will build a
      positive atmosphere and a team spirit. It also will allow you choose the
      best part of everybody’s contribution to build the best solution to the
      problem at hand.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At such meetings, your opinion is very
      important, so, do not ever make any uninformed decision. Throwing your
      support behind any issue on which you know close to nothing about, or
      which you know you will certainly lose the vote, will gradually reduce
      your influence among your followers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, before you go in for any
      decision-making-meeting, be prepared. Do all your background work. Ensure
      you have all the needed facts and figures as regards all the issues you
      are</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">presenting to your audience. This will help
      you win their vote with ease.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Before making up your mind on any issue at
      the meeting, irrespective of the number of consultations you have made
      before the meeting, asking for the opinion of others in the meeting may
      give you a different outlook of the issue under discussion and you will be
      able to explore divergent views that were not previously considered.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you are really sure of your
      convictions or not, ask for your team’s opinion before you form yours.
      Some of them need to be encouraged before they can speak out their minds;
      encourage them. One way to encourage those who speak out their minds is to
      let them know that they are appreciated and that their opinions are
      valuable.</p>
          </div>
          <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
           <p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that the project sounds timely and
      laudable to you does not mean others will feel the same way. So, encourage
      open discussion. Hear them out at the meeting. If you do not, you will be
      seen as a leader who does only what he pleases, whenever he pleases,
      however it pleases him, and this will surely get you where you are not
      pleased to be.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a leader, you must learn to listen with
      an open mind. Unless you want to single-handedly carry out the whole
      project, take the final decision with your team. No one is an island of
      wisdom. No one can think of every possible situation. No one knows it all.
      To be a great leader, you will need to get ideas from others, listen to
      their points of view, and make them suggest alternatives, even if they
      differ from what you intend.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It does not take long for youths to term
      their leader a dictator, especially if they feel he is the only one
      responsible for the generation of the idea and the decision-making. Youth
      leadership is not like a military regime where force can be applied to get
      things done. It is not a paramilitary college. It is either they willingly
      want to do it with you or they leave you to do it alone.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Actively involve your team members in
      decision making. You may already have a ready answer to the puzzle, but
      seeking their opinion will encourage their participation. Give them
      freedom to make their own decisions. This makes them feel like co-leaders,
      not laborers in another man’s vineyard.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At the point of decision making, no personal
      conflict must be allowed to affect the decisions which will be made. If
      care is not taken at such meetings, selfish motives will creep in and
      affect the quality of the decision to be made. Thus, in turn, will affect
      the house, adversely.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do your best to avoid selfish interest and
      hidden agenda. You cannot have your way every time. Leadership is not all
      about making orders and decrees, neither is it about enforcing personal
      decisions using positional authority. It is about leading the group both
      in wise decision making, and being actively involved in the process of its
      accomplishment.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">WHEN YOUR IDEAS ARE QUESTIONED</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">However relevant the project is to your
      followers, some may still question the merit of the project either because
      of their genuine interest in the group, or their selfish interest and
      personal gains.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some of your advices may be rejected, some
      motions realigned and some of your ideas forcefully kicked against. As a
      good leader, you need to know how to handle such people responsibly, and
      also to handle your emotions when dealing with them or else you will blow
      things out of proportion.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Accept them all in good faith and in the
      spirit of good sportsmanship. Do not see these questionings as opposition
      or resistance to your leadership, especially if they are issue-based and
      not based on personal conflicts. That your team members always question
      you is not a sign of disagreement; they are indicating their need for
      better clarification. Do not get offended because of this. Your workforce
      are not looking for your down fall; so, trust their judgment.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Be willing to explain again and again until
      the last person or, at least, a majority of the people in the decision
      making committee understand your stand. Do not force anyone to agree; make
      them see reasons. Remember, if your tenure must be successful, you will
      need their cooperation, and to get their cooperation, you will need to win
      their heart. The fact that you have won their votes does not mean they
      will swear their 100% allegiance to you. They have a choice as to what to
      accept and what not to.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Although, it is greatly annoying when
      followers deliberately disagree with your opinion, especially with regard
      to issues which you have devoted time to think about and have arrived at a
      logical conclusion. However, if you will be willing to give them a chance
      to air their view, they will reveal their foolishness and shallow
      mindedness. It is then they will begin to appreciate the kind of leader
      they have and then argue less with you. If you</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">deny them this opportunity, you may be seen
      as a domineering leader, and the consequence, as discussed earlier will
      not be palatable.</p>
          </div>
          <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In the event that they are wrong, you do not
      need to shower abusive language on them, showing them your mental prowess
      and thinking ability. Just explain carefully to them why you chose that
      alternative above others; and they will learn to respect your opinion next
      time. Then it will no longer be your sole decision; it will be the general
      decision of the house, and you will be loved the more for it. If you
      prefer to shout them down, the hurting party may take offence and gang up
      against you, frustrating all your efforts to make the idea succeed, even
      if the idea is a good one.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">WHEN YOUR IDEAS ARE REJECTED</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Alternatively, it may be the other way
      round. When your followers have aired their views, you may discover you
      are completely wrong, or at least, not as right as you thought you were.
      Your thoughtlessness, at such times, will be open to all.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At such times, your working committee may be
      forced to discard your idea for another. It will be unreasonable to expect
      that they will always embrace every proposal you present to them. Others
      too may have better options, and this may make them abandon your proposal
      for the better alternative.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is in no way meant to spite you. Be not
      hard on them. Be courteous and kind to those who do not share your
      opinion. They are not against you, they are just willing to see the group
      grow, and this should gladden your heart.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Take it in good faith. Admit your errors and
      faults. Do not insist on the acceptance of your own ideas every time,
      especially when it is so obvious that there are better alternatives. Such
      attitude portrays immaturity on your part. Never impose your views on
      anyone. Be thoughtful of their opinions. Respect every one’s view as
      different as they may be from your own.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If the idea of the leadership is rejected,
      it does not mean the leader is rejected. They still love and want to have
      you as their leader. That is not debatable. Therefore, waste no time
      trying to defend your present position. It is not a sign of good
      leadership. A Yiddish proverb says “Protest long enough that you are
      right, and you will be wrong.”</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You need not stubbornly stick to your old
      idea because you are the leader and the mantle of authority lies in your
      hand. Since it is now obvious to all that your idea is porous, and that
      there is a better way to go about it, trying to be defensive will not help
      matters. Building a self-defense only show that you are not ready to let
      go of your idea, irrespective of whatever is wrong with it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Be quick to relax on the issue and do not
      press further. The case at hand is simple. Just admit that you missed out
      on some cogent point while assessing the situation (which in most cases
      may be the whole truth) and that was responsible for your initial choice.
      This is the evidence of good leadership. When you have to, acknowledge
      your methods are not as effective as you thought they would be. Assure
      them that you will be willing to shift grounds now that you have a clearer
      view of the situation at hand. This admission will in no way reduce you as
      a leader, neither will it make them look down on you. On the contrary, it</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">will portray you as a leader with a
      listening hear and a teachable spirit.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If given the chance, go back home and do
      your homework well. When you return with a better alternative, you will
      get a standing ovation.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To take undue advantage of your poor
      presentation, some others who do not flow readily with your leadership
      style and projects may also suggest ideas which you may not want to buy
      into. It will not make much sense to become argumentative with them or to
      take offence in them. You do not have to shout them down, everyone at the
      meeting already has an inclination that you are not in the best of terms
      with them. Doing this will confirm everybody’s fear that you are an
      unforgiving and wicked leader. Simply throw their idea on the table for
      general discussion. If you really have surrounded yourself with good
      brains as discussed under the chapter that addresses building your
      workforce, the idea itself will determine its own stand. If it is one that
      cannot hold water, it will melt away during critical assessment by the
      house without you making more enemies for yourself.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">WHEN YOU ARE NOT TOO SURE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When you are ignorant about an issue or a
      topic, do not always be the first to speak. Accept guidance from others.
      Let your people debate the issue first among themselves until you get the
      whole idea. This should be done orderly.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Even when there is division in the house,
      work on them until there is a general agreement. Make sure everyone
      reaches a</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">consensus. Rather than argue against one
      another, let them brain storm, it is better this way.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As the leader, listen before you speak. Do
      not just listen; listen well and learn. Do not exercise zeal without
      knowledge. Delay all actions until you know what the issue is all about.
      Listen to them. Access all the sides of the story, weigh the pros &amp;
      cons before you take a stand. Listen attentively while others bare their
      minds on the issue, else you will expose your folly.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Simply sum up the discussion at major
      intervals. Gather relevant facts and information, such that when you open
      your mouth to speak, your words will be laced with great wisdom. It is
      better to speak last and say words of wisdom than to speak hastily and
      later regret your action.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">LAST WORD</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In decision making, two things are key for
      the youth leader to be careful about:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. Taking nobody’s advice</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. Taking everyone’s advice</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The first is what we have discussed all
      through this chapter. The second is the exact opposite – taking
      everybody’s advice.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is much wisdom in limiting decision
      making to only those involved in taking the decision and those whom the
      decision is going to affect directly. You do not have to sample everyone’s
      opinion if everyone is not going to be affected; you only need to carry
      them along.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Sampling everyone’s opinion may sound ideal,
      but if not well handled, especially in a large crowd, the choice of some
      youths’ opinion to the neglect of others may generate serious crisis among
      the rest of the youths.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You will definitely receive so many advices
      and counsels unsolicited. Some of them are needed, some of them are not.
      Some are out of pure hearts with the simple motive of moving you forward,
      others with selfish interests and hidden motives.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If the decision has nothing to do with a set
      of your followers, you only need to let them know why you are taking the
      decision and how it is going to make life better for the totality of them
      all. Let them know what you have gone through in taking the decision. Let
      them know you have contacted the parties involved and you have their
      consent. Unnecessarily involving people who are not relevant to the
      discussions and who are not stakeholders always makes decision making
      process unreasonably complicated.</p>
