										<h2>PREFACE</h2>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">This is not one of my common practices. I
											  really do not take any special interest in writing letters to people I do
											  not know, some of whom I may never meet before leaving planet earth.
											  However, this particular one has become pertinent in my heart such that I
											  need to pen it down just because of you.</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;"> This is not just another book on
											  leadership. It is a compilation of things I have learnt about leadership
											  which I wished I had learnt earlier while on campus.</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;"> The purpose of this book is to correct the
											  anomalies in the upcoming leaders and encourage the birth of a new breed
											  of leadership among our youths. It is to bring clarity to the issue of
											  youth leadership, forewarning every leader ahead of time about the
											  challenges of leadership and forearming them with needed facts to do a
											  successful work among the youths.</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;"> This purpose can be summarized in two major
											  words:<br>
											  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) To forewarn<br>
											  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) To forearm</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;"> Therefore, if you are involved in youth
											  leadership anywhere, this book is meant for you. Regardless of the level
											  at which you exercise your leadership, be it in your church, on your
											  street, in your class, department, faculty, hostel, dormitory, students
											  union government, fellowship, or even in your room! All youth leaders must
											  read this!</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;"> As long as you have a measure of influence
											  somewhere, and on someone, no matter how minute or how enormous, and you
											  desire to exercise your influence in a better way, this book is written
											  with you in my mind.</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;"> This book will help you navigate through
											  the subtle ocean of youth leadership, charting your course through to
											  success. It is skillfully written to equip every young leader with the
											  necessary tools to press through barriers in order to get the job done.</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;"> If this book can change the life of at
											  least one youth leader, I will be the happier for it; knowing that the
											  changed life will affect several other lives, and the several others will,
											  in turn, affect several others, until the leaders of future generations
											  are all touched.</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;"> I sincerely, prayerfully, hope
											  that the one life who will start this chain reaction will be you - I mean
											  the person holding this book now.</p>

											<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">Youths are integral, peculiar and important
											  part of the society. They are also bundle of potentials. They have their
											  needs, challenges and aspiration. They are not to be neglected or ignored
											  by any group, community, church or nation but rather harnessed and
											  deployed to fulfill their special place as a segment of the larger
											  population.</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">To neglect or ignore the youth is to
											  jeopardize and endanger the future and that is why the nation and more so
											  the church should invest in youth ministry. It is also observed that
											  church’s investment in the youth ministry needs to be jerked up as we seek
											  to create an enduring tomorrow that will bring glory to God and blessings
											  to us.</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">Many churches and organizations are involved
											  in youth ministry but we are not reaping much benefit from it because it
											  is fraught with shortcomings in terms of planning and execution. As a
											  result, many who are involved in youth ministries have either called it
											  quit or are experiencing various forms of frustration. The author, our
											  dear Brother Sam. O. Salau, who is also a youth and has been involved in
											  the youth ministry for so many years, offers insightful ideas on how
											  successful youth ministry in the church could be run.</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">Every church need to be committed to youth
											  oriented ministry for several reasons: it is a worthy effort and desirable
											  investment. The blessings of a co-ordinated, well planned and God-inspired
											  effort in youth ministry will outlast us. Investing in youth ministry is
											  the wise thing to do, particularly for the church, if we are interested in
											  building a lasting and solid future for the church and the society. Every
											  church, society or nation must get it right on issues concerning the youth
											  and that is why no effort should be spared by all concerned.</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the reasons ministry among the youth
											  has not been effective as it should be is that some people who are leading
											  the youths today find themselves in the position by accident and are not
											  fully prepared for the challenges it entails. This book provides the
											  guidance on how such people can find their rhythm in the assignment.</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">As leaders in our respective areas we also
											  have the mandate to influence the youth positively and thus raise them to
											  the right standard ethically, morally and spiritually, and reading this
											  book will help us to appreciate this truth. The issues raised are not only
											  important to running a successful youth ministry but they are equally
											  valuable guides to achieving success in whatever ministry God has
											  entrusted into our care. Paul wrote, “Say to Archippus, that thou fulfill
											  thy ministry” – Colossians 4:17. The book is a motivation for fulfillment
											  in ministry. It is highly commended to youth leaders, those aspiring to be
											  youth leaders, parents, those whose ministry revolves around the youth and
											  all those who desire to see success achieved in youth ministry.</p>

										<h2>Comments</h2>
										<p align="justify">The Challenges of Preacher’s Kid or as it is sweetly coined in the book ‘PK’ is a book that has brought to bear the many challenges faced in the dual roles of a Preacher and their children, giving the huge expectations placed on a Preacher’s kid, and some of the fallouts that have been experienced by some and also the many responsibilities placed on a Preacher’s kid.</p>
										<p align="justify">The book extensively dealt with the challenges faced by every child born in the homes of a Preacher/Pastor; the dual roles of being a child and also being a Preacher’s child, and that of being a Parent and also being the Pastor of your child. These roles are challenging and must be effectively carried out with wisdom and discernment by understanding the distinct roles and knowing when each of these roles must be carried out in effective parenting and pastoring.</p>
										<p align="justify">This book is a passionate expression of a concerned parent of Pastor’s Kids whose burden deserves to be shared. It is an uncommon book needed in the Church and society. The book although titled “CHALLENGES OF A PASTOR’S KID, does not emphasize the negatives about the status of Pastor’s children. It is a balanced approach to the realities affecting Pastor’s kids both in positive and negative sides.</p>
										<p align="justify">The author, Sam O. Salau, analyzed the numerous demands on Pastor’s kids without any specified training to qualify them for such demands. It is interesting to see the author confirming the call of God evident on Pastor’s kids through their parental “priesthood” and the beauty with blessings attached to it. By this, he encouraged the Pastor’s kids to value and protect the “priesthood” of their family.</p>
										<p align="justify">This book in its capacity commends the status of Pastor’s kids, corrects the errors of Pastor’s kids and recommends the roles of their parents, the church leaders and members to make them models and successors to the ministry of their parents.</p>
										<p align="justify">The author, Pastor Sam O. Salau is passionate about today and tomorrow of the Pastor’s Kids and the ministry of their Pastor parents. Those of like minds should purchase and circulate this book for the benefits of their Pastors and congregations. More than this, the book should be read, appropriated and applied.</p>

										Pastor Sam thanks a million for taking the challenge of writing a book on this sensitive aspect of life. Pastors are trained for ministry not their kids. This book is a 'school' for Pastors' Kids how I pray that the book will get to every pastor's home. The title reads CHALLENGES OF A PASTOR'S KIDS but it's a must read for every pastor as well. I will recommend this book to even church members as this will help them help the pastor and his family to fulfill ministry. Well done!</p>

										<p align="justify">It is a general knowledge that everyone expects so much from a Pastors’ child; they are not seen like the normal everyday child, rather they are seen as the perfect ones and expected to act like one. Sam. O. Salau has identified a whole lot of these challenges and has proffer solutions and also the best ways that would help anyone that is either a ‘PK’, or the Parents of a ‘PK’ to live out the fullness of what is expected of them by God.</p>
										<p align="justify">Sam. O. Salau has given a distinct analysis and broad knowledge of every individual that helps shape the lives of a ‘PK’. Challenges of Pastors’ Kids has been written in one of the most simplest forms to make reading interesting, lessons also learnt and applying the principles in the book easy to adapt.</p>
										<p align="justify">The in-depth of this book shows a lot of research was done. Everyone that has a relationship with a ‘PK’ would be doing a great help, building up, teachings and giving them the truth about their roles as a ‘PK’ when you make them read this book. This book has to be read by every Preacher/Pastor.</p>
										<p align="justify">Sam.O.Salau has done a wonderful work by writing this book and its certainly coming at the right time when our society needs it.</p>

He systematically proffers solutions both to the Pastors' Kids and their parents, including lay members. I recommend this book to all pastors' parents and their kids especially young singles going into the ministry.</p>

										<p align="justify">Finally we have a point of succor for the many challenges of the Pastor's kid. We thank God for the gift of Pastor Sam Salau and men like him who release their mind to conceive Divine Burden. This is a very rare but long-overdue piece that addresses a very peculiar subject. Some of us who have been Pastors' kids for over the quarter of a century cannot but strongly identify with this work. Still, for those of us who have chosen the path that our Fathers trod, it is all the more relevant. My reckoning is that this work is not only for the Pastor and his Kids, but also for everyone who has a Pastor and whose pastor has at least one kid.</p>
