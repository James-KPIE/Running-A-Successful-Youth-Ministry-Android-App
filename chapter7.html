<p style="text-align: center;">Chapter Seven</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">COMMUNICATE YOUR VISION CLEARLY</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So much depends on how you communicate your
      vision to your followers. In communicating your vision to them, you must
      speak the language they can understand. You must know what to communicate
      and how to communicate it. The extent to which your followers understand
      what you communicate will be the extent of their support for you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The difference between peaceful audience and
      a rioting crowd is in what is communicated to them and the difference
      between obedient followers and rebellious mammoth is in the way the
      information is communicated. No matter how great your plans look, poor
      presentation will adversely affect their acceptance among your followers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Many leaders do not see the need to work on
      their mode of communication, therefore, some of the best and brilliant
      ideas have been discarded by the followership because they were not
      properly communicated, and so, were not understood. Alternatively, and sad
      to say, many worthless ones have been embraced wholeheartedly by the
      followers just because of the mode of expression from the leaders.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Discussed below are some of the things a
      leader will need to give attention to, if he wants to learn how to
      communicate persuasively.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>EXPLAIN THE REASONS</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you really need to pass a message across
      to your followers, and you desire that they carry the instruction out, do
      not just stop at telling them what you want to do, or what you want them
      to do in order for you to achieve what you want. You must be ready to
      emphasize why you want to do what you want to do, and why you also want
      them to do what you want them to do.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is not just about telling them what
      direction to follow, but to convince them that the direction you are
      leading them through is the best for the moment. Youths naturally will not
      just do what they are told to do unless they see a reason to. Their
      inquisitive nature needs to be satisfied. So, give them a reason, let them
      know why it is important to them. Let everyone see the reason why the
      decision you are making is of utmost significance to him personally.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">“Why” is a great word! The answer to the
      “why” question can solve a lot of riddles and save a lot of heartaches. It
      can make some of the most rebellious followers become the most obedient
      ones. Most youths will do anything if they are convinced that they should
      do it. They have sharp and organized minds, and are unlikely to revolt
      against a very reasonable idea, except there is a negative influence over
      them which is contending for your position. Once you can appeal to their
      reasoning, you can gain their support.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Be ready to explain things to them in a
      general assembly. If need be, you may have to explain again to individuals
      who may feel that they still need more clarifications on it, and who
      summon the courage to approach you one-on-one about it. Do not take any
      offence in their boldness. Some others will say worse things behind you
      that you will never hear off.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It will be a very costly assumption to think
      that everyone knows why you are embarking on the projects. Do not fall
      into such an error. Take your time to explain things to them. When youths
      are not well informed, they become bad followers but when they have
      accurate information, they become the best supporters which a leader can
      have.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is one great undoing of most leaders.
      They do not take their time to organize their thoughts around the “why”,
      not to mention communicating these “why”. On the few occasions they do, it
      is centered on their own short sighted perspective of the issue at hand,
      and they still expect every youth to reason with them. The followers are
      not allowed to say anything that will open these thought lines up for
      scrutiny and proper evaluation.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why youths are labeled rebels. They
      are likely to challenge such leadership. If the leadership, by any means,
      is able to keep them from challenging his authority, then you can be sure
      that he has succeeded in creating a gap between his leadership and the
      followers. If this style continues, the gap will widen by the day until it
      is obvious to all that the leadership has no strong hold on the
      followership.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>COMMUNICATE PERSUASIVELY</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The second thing to do to create instant
      followership for your visions and dream is to be enthusiastic about your
      goals. Each time you need to communicate your ideas to them. Do so with
      all enthusiasm.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Being a leader, you must allow your
      conviction and your enthusiasm rub off on everyone else. Your passion can
      become contagious if you really know how to handle it. If you make the
      best of it, it can give birth to genuine interest and concern in almost
      all of your followers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Since the success and the deficiencies of
      your team will be due to how best you can carry them along at the stage of
      communicating your ideas to them. Each time you need to communicate with
      your followers, let your gestures and your speech pattern emphasize your
      thought line. Communicate in such a way that it will infuse your team with
      enthusiasm and excitement. In your expressions, let them see much more
      than you say.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In whatever form of language each one can
      understand, encourage them to do what they have to do. Do all you can to
      raise their level of commitment and inspire them to peak performance.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The enthusiasm and vigor with which people
      seek to accomplish their own dreams cannot be compared with the little
      they invest in another man’s dream. If you can sell the idea to them and
      make them believe in it, you will achieve greater success with it in no
      time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not just make it your idea, make it their
      idea. After all, it really does not matter whose idea it is. What should
      matter to you and the organization is the result. With the result, the
      credit comes to you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>EMPLOY DIPLOMACY</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond what you say, you will need to be
      careful about the way you say it, when you say it, and to whom you say it.
      Do not just tell it as it is. Be tactful. Tell no lie; but pass the truth
      across with wisdom. Watch the season so as to know when to say what has to
      be said. It tells how much acceptance you get.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A single statement can either get you into
      trouble or get you out of trouble. Whenever you want to speak, make sure
      what you want to say is worth saying. If not, wait a little longer. Wise
      men know when to speak, and when not to; how to speak when they have to.
      Do not be careless: Everything cannot be said at any time and anyhow.</p>

                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Before embarking on the project of
      communicating your ideas to your followers (because it is indeed a project
      on its own), do your homework. Figure out what you have to say before you
      start to say it. Think through what you want to say before facing the
      crowd. Think along other people’s thought line; think about their fears,
      think about their needs, think about the objections they are likely to
      raise, think about their criticisms and provide ready answers to each of
      them even before you face them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This, definitely, will save you from
      embarrassment when communicating the idea to them. If any of them decides
      to ask a pre-thought question, you will have a direct, well thought out,
      less volatile, and honest ready answer to allay their fears, and</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">consequently portray yourself as a leader
      who is worth his office.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Remember, you have become a voice for the
      people who you are leading. Most times, you will have to stand before
      higher authorities to represent your people and at the same time stand
      before your people to represent the higher authorities. It is possible for
      one party to think you are being partisan.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is even possible, often, that the youths
      will want to take out their anger for the higher authorities on you, or
      that the higher authority will want to blame and punish you for the
      laxities in the actions of the generality of the youths. This is always
      the case. Therefore, be quick to listen, but be slow to speak.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Even when you are called upon to deliver
      impromptu speeches, communicate thoughtfully and clearly. Intermittently
      pause to reflect on the next statement you are about to make. Take your
      time to calculate the consequence of your words before voicing them out.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>BE IN CHARGE OF YOUR TEMPER</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Whether in anger or in response to someone
      in anger, use gentle words! You cannot control the action of others’ but
      you can control your reaction to their actions. Do not let your temper get
      the better of you; control yourself.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Raising your voice will not make the youths
      obey you more than they are willing to. Screaming at them will change
      nothing. They do not have hearing problems; they only need to be
      approached the proper way.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For your communication to be effective, it
      has to get their attention, and for it to get their attention, it has to
      make sense to them. For it to make sense to them, it has to be said in a
      way that they will understand. For them to understand well, you need to
      control your temper.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Stay cool; blowing hot will not make matters
      easy for you. Either learn to control the manner in which you speak when
      you are annoyed, or reserve whatever you want to say for a later time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>BE CONFIDENTIAL</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a leader, what you communicate and who
      you communicate it to will make a lot of difference. There are issues
      which can only be discussed at meetings with only the relevant team
      members and stakeholders. Such discussions and decisions made at such
      meetings may not be meant for public hearing until the time is right.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your degree of success is determined by how
      much of such discussions you can keep away from those who it does not
      concern. Know what to communicate and what not to communicate in the
      presence of some people.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">God gave us two ears but one mouth. This
      means you are to speak only half as much as you hear. If you do, you will
      get yourself out of unnecessary troubles. Running a loose mouth is not a
      quality of a good leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once your followers discover that you do not
      know how to shut your mouth when you need to, rather than see you as a
      leader who is interested in their progress, they will conclude that you</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">have become an enemy of progress to them;
      and they will treat you accordingly.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Be conscious of your environment at every
      given time. Always know what to say whenever you are with people.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>CLARITY</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Unless your communication is clear enough,
      you risk being misconstrued, misunderstood and misrepresented. This does
      happen to youth leaders from time to time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most times, when we think we are
      communicating our plans, we do so with all authority, presenting our ideas
      the best way we can. We seem to be sure of what we are doing, where we are
      coming from, where we are, and where we are going to. At times, we only
      know this. Our followers are wondering what we are saying because they do
      not have a clear grasp of what we mean. The message we send is not the
      message they receive.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You assume you have passed your intentions
      across and expect that by now everybody should buy into the vision, but
      what you have actually done is, if anything, gotten them more confused
      than they were at the beginning and so, no one seems to want to follow
      your idea. Then you conclude they are not cooperative and supportive. The
      problem is not with them, it lies with you. You have not connected with
      them in the simplest and best way they will understand.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">When addressing your followers, be as
      explicit as possible. Be down to earth. Get everyone to see the larger
      picture. Communicate your vision to them in such a way that they will
      adopt it as their own. This will not come easily. You should not</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">expect that they will naturally begin to
      care as deeply as you do about your own dream. It will take more than just
      talking to them about it. It will take real personal convictions. They
      will have to accept the vision as theirs, embrace it, and run with it; and
      this only comes when it is well passed across.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In communicating ideas to your followers,
      simplicity is important. Be specific. Be exact. Be precise. Streamline
      your thoughts. The more precise you are about your goals, the clearer it
      will be to them, and the more they will embrace it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping your choice of words simple will
      solve a lot of problems during communication. Using big, ambiguous and
      complex composition of words may sometimes get the audience excited, but
      they are likely to miscomprehend you once in a while. Learn to speak the
      right words.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to youths, just a word can
      make all the needed difference. A single statement can hold as much wisdom
      as a long passage, if well-constructed. Whatever information you want to
      pass across, take your time to choose your words. You may avoid a lot of
      chaos by doing this.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>ADD SOME COLOUR</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your followers do not like to be bored
      whenever they are in a meeting. This is why each time they have programs
      of their own, a major part of it will be the side attractions. One of the
      things they call side attraction is to intentionally look for people to
      make them laugh; and they pay for it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is because they know that most times,
      their leaders do not share their idea of what catching fun is about, and
      so will not</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">make provision for it. So, they invite
      someone whom their generation calls a stand-up comedian, and pay him
      heavily just to make them laugh. This shows what importance your followers
      attach to the issue of catching fun. And if you understand how they feel,
      you will present your most distasteful dish to them in a capsule they will
      be willing to swallow.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">No one really loves to be made sad; not even
      the youths. They like fun; add some for them. This does not mean you have
      to water down whatever you want to say.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once in a while, when occasions allow for
      it, do something different, and do it in a creative way. Use an
      audio-visual aid or a projection slide to enhance your communication.
      Throw a nice complement. Share a joke. Tell a short story. Make an
      illustration to drive home your point. Say something funny. Whatever you
      are going to do, make it relevant to your general presentation for that
      day. It keeps them glued to you whenever you are talking, and they keep
      looking forward to the next meeting when they will have the opportunity to
      listen to you again.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once you get to this level with your
      followers, there is little or nothing you cannot achieve with them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>LACE IT WITH WISDOM</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever color you add to your words, your
      words will not carry weight unless they are words of wisdom. Each time you
      want to say a thing, make sure your words are words of knowledge.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Bible says wisdom is the principal
      thing, and also advises that in all thy getting, get understanding. This
      sums it all.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Always communicate in wisdom. Once they see
      your level of understanding and maturity in the display of wisdom each
      time you speak on general issues, they will begin to bring very personal
      issues to you for counsel and clarification. This, is a sign of great
      respect for the grace of great wisdom in display each time you speak.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>YOUTHS GENERAL REACTION TO LEADERSHIP</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Youth leadership is about one of the most
      complex organizations in the society. It is harder to lead than most
      others. Some people may feel you are too hard at a time when others
      complain you are too weak. This can be confusing.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may feel that people should generally
      feel enthusiastic about the ideas you have which you think will move your
      organization forward, but you will be surprised that some will still
      resent your leadership.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There five types of followers every leader
      will have to contend with. There are those who:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. RESPECT LEADERSHIP</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The first group consists of those who
      respect leadership. They do their best to support the leadership. They
      never cause chaos or initiate problems. They are the easy going followers.
      Most times, you may even take them for granted because they never
      complain. They may be called zombies, not because they are</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">daft, but because they are always
      comfortable with whatever decision the leadership takes, good or bad.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. ENDURE THE LEADERSHIP</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The second group consists of those who
      endure the leadership. These ones too, although as easy going as the first
      group, are not as quiet as they are. These ones complain when they find
      things they are not comfortable with. They do not make trouble, but they
      will let the leadership know that they are not in support of their
      actions.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once the leadership is insistent in doing
      what these ones do not like, the only thing they do is keep quiet, keep
      low, and keep praying that its time will soon be up. They endure the
      leadership until that prayer is answered. Most times the answer comes
      faster than they can imagine.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">All leaders must be careful with this group
      of people. They may not be troublemakers, but their advice is worth much
      more than you can imagine.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. INFLUENCE LEADERSHIP</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This third group consists of people who want
      to become an influence over the leadership. They seem to, indirectly,
      control the affairs of the group by dictating to the leadership what they
      feel needs to be done per time.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="settings">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">This may be because of their influence on
      the group, or on the leader, or their influence on the committee or group
      that selected or elected the leader into position. They feel they are
      still in charge and should be heard. Some of them even feel that the</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">leader should seek permission from them
      before doing anything in office.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The earlier a leader learns to dissociate
      from such people, the better for him. Most times, they become a clog in
      the wheel of his progress.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>4. FIGHT LEADERSHIP</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the most problematic groups.
      They are the trouble makers. All they do is look for reasons to foment
      trouble. If there is none, they create one. They intentionally set traps
      for the leader so they will have opportunity to pick quarrels with him.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once you identify these ones, keep as far
      away as possible from them. Nothing good will come from your relationship
      with them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>5. CHANGE THE LEADERSHIP</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The last group is those who are not
      interested in the leadership because he is not one of their own people.
      All they do is with the single intention to remove him from leadership, so
      that they can put one of their own.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These five groups of people every leader
      will find among his followers. So be prepared to deal with each
      accordingly. Once you can get maximum co-operation from a larger
      percentage of each group, you are bound to succeed. The first thing you
      will need to do is to identify them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to these five, there are two
      other sets of people whom your success is hinged on.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. THOSE YOU DEPEND ON</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These are the people whom your success as a
      leader is dependent on something which they have to do during your tenure.
      Doing what they have to do may not affect you directly, but will still
      contribute to the final success which you envisage. If these ones fail to
      do these, you are likely to be affected adversely.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once you identify them, know how to deal
      with them. Monitor them from time to time to ensure that they do what they
      should do when they have to do it. Make their problem your problem,
      because it is indeed your problem.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These can be the people on your executive
      board, your departmental leaders or your workforce.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. THOSE THAT DEPEND ON YOU</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These ones are the exact opposite of the
      other one. What you are to the group above, these ones are to you. In the
      other group, you were the dependant, but in this group they are the
      dependants. Their success lies solely on something which you have to do.
      If you fail to do it, you may jeopardize their success.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You also need to learn how to deal with
      them. To a large extent, they will be at your mercy, and you can decide to
      do whatever you will with them. You call the shots here. However, you must
      remember that whatever goes round comes round. However well or badly you
      treat the people who depend on you, God will make sure that those
      you depend on also treat you in like manner.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Make it very easy for the people who need
      your favor to get it, and those you need their favor will not deny you.</p>
