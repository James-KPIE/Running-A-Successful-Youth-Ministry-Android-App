    <h2 style="text-align: center;">MAKING MAXIMUM IMPACT</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">On the day you relinquish power, you must
      have something to show for your leadership appointment else you will
      disappoint those who trusted you enough to appoint you a leader. The
      reason why they appointed you in the first place is because they felt you
      had something worthwhile to offer the unit. If you hand over without
      offering the quality leadership that will take their lives and the group
      forward, your tenure, no matter how short or long, will be a waste of
      time, and will soon be forgotten.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The main regrets you will have, after your
      tenure is over, are over the things you know you should have done but did
      not do, whatever the reasons you may have for not doing them. On that</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">day, whatever excuse you have for not making
      visible impact in the lives of your followers will not hold water. You
      will either walk out of the Hand Over Ceremony with shoulders lifted high
      or with head bowed down.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If your desire is to make maximum impact in
      that youth organization so that subsequent regimes can make your
      administration a point of reference, then it is going to demand a lot from
      you. You must be ready to give it all it takes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">WHAT PROJECTS DO I UNDERTAKE?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every leader who wants to lead successfully
      must set a clear and definite goal. This is one of the first
      major steps a leader who wants to have serious influence on his people
      must take.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">An average youth organization, be it in the
      church, on the campus, or in the community is such that a leader without
      focus is easily driven about by attacks and criticism from others. This is
      so pronounced that even some leaders who have well lined up goals still
      lose focus along the way, not to mention those without goals.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The issue of goal setting and planning goes
      beyond leading the youths. It is applicable to every meaningful and
      worthwhile project in life. Any project, whatever the magnitude, done
      without a well lined up plan, is bound to fail. So it is with leadership.
      If you see a leader who fails to set the goals he wants to achieve during
      his tenure, or fails to plan how he wants to go about it, his failure is
      at hand.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are not sure of how to get to where
      you are going before you kick off, you most likely will find yourself
      where you do</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">not intend. The first thing you need to do
      as a leader is to determine where you are heading to. This is called goal
      setting.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What projects are you going to undertake in
      this administration? Which of them will be your major project? Which ones
      will be your minor projects or pet projects? These should be the first
      questions on your mind. These projects are your goals.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Youth leadership in this age should be
      creative rather than maintenance leadership. It is not just about
      maintaining the status quo of the previous administration; it is about
      taking innovative steps and undertaking worthwhile projects that will take
      each unit of the organization forward. If you do not have any of such
      goals, you have no right being a youth leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why those who contest for leadership
      positions declare their manifestoes even before contesting. A manifesto is
      the list of your intentions and a proposal of the projects you will
      undertake when you are finally elected into office.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may or may not be required to declare a
      manifesto before being appointed or elected a leader, but you will
      definitely need a manifesto. You will need to commit yourself to a written
      goal from the start. The true goal of a leader is to lead his followers
      from where they are to where they should be; to take their focus away from
      what they have achieved to what they are yet to achieve.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What happens if the leader does not know
      where the group should head? It will be a case of the blind leading the
      blind. They will both go in the wrong direction. This is why a leader
      needs a game plan. Even if you did not need one to get to where</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">you are, you will need one to take you from
      where you are to where you should be.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order not to go in the wrong direction,
      deciding ahead which direction you want to go is important. Have a clear
      conception of what you want; a vivid vision, creatively imagined,
      concretely planned, serially documented, and itemized to every minute
      detail.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Go for distinct aims and objectives. Be
      known for, at least, one major goal. If your followers do not know what
      you stand for, they will not follow you. No one wants to follow a man who
      does not know where he is heading to! And a leader without any follower is
      not leading anyone anywhere. You need to know what to do in order to get
      to where you want to go, else you will keep roaming around the same point.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So, help yourself by listing out the things
      you feel need to be done in the group. The following factors will help you
      decide what projects you will need to undertake. Let these factors
      influence your list.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. SOLVE THE PROBLEMS YOU MEET</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your number one assignment as a leader is to
      solve the problems you meet. This is the best place to start from: solving
      the most pressing problem of the youths you are leading. Watch out for
      needs that other leaders before you paid no attention to, or the ones they
      paid serious attention to but were not able to surmount.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Look for where people are hurting. Look
      around for inherited problems from the former regime, pressing issues and</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">challenges which your predecessors
      overlooked. Make it a point of duty to first find solutions to these at
      the beginning of your tenure. This will make your tenure acceptable to
      your followers from the start. If resources will not be a stumbling block,
      start from the biggest one; biggest successes come from finding solutions
      to the biggest problems.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. APPRAISE THE PROGRAMS ON GROUND</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The second thing you should naturally do is
      to appraise the programs you meet. Watch out for already existing programs
      and decide what to do about these.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In considering what to do with them, group
      these programs under these three major headings. Wherever each of them
      falls will determine what is ideal to be done to it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A. What to abolish</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">B. What to continue</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">C. What to improve on</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A.) WHAT TO ABOLISH</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some programs were initiated to solve some
      management or time-bound problems, but long after the problems were
      solved, the programs still remains. Such programs have overstayed their
      usefulness and will only do more harm than good. Such programs should be
      abolished.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Any other program that makes life more
      difficult for your followers should be abolished. Your goal should be to
      make life more comfortable for them and anything that stands in-between
      you and such goals should be abolished.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To decide if an idea or a project is
      obsolete, sincerely ask yourself first and ask for your followers’ honest
      opinions later. Let them answer these questions -</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Why should we continue with this?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What do we stand to gain if we do?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What do we stand to lose if we do not?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Is it still relevant to us as a group in
      this age and time?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Has it fulfilled its purpose and has since
      become obsolete?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Is that the best way to spend our resources?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Answering these questions will put you in a
      better place to determine if such programs are worthwhile or not. However,
      you will need to be careful in handling this issue. Some of your followers
      who still adore these programs, or who benefit financially or otherwise
      from these programs may put up a strong opposition. You will need to
      display a high maturity level in trying to persuade them. Once you can
      successfully convince those who have selfish interests to protect, the
      program is as good as gone.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">B.) WHAT TO CONTINUE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some other programs will still be relevant
      to your followers. These programs should not by any means be eliminated.
      As long as the programs still bless their lives, discontinuing them may
      cause some serious problems among your youths. Some of them may even
      allege reflexively that you have some hidden agenda or selfish reason why
      you want to cancel the programs. So tread softly.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, you do not have to
      replicate, verbatim, what others have done in the past. It gives you no
      real credit. It portrays you as someone with no creativity or ingenuity.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than continue with a program the way
      it is, do the next thing – improve on it.</p>

										<p style="text-align: justify;">C.) WHAT TO IMPROVE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than continue with a program the way
      it is, improve on it. Every program that has brought your followers peace,
      rest of mind, and progress in their personal lives should be retained but
      repackaged.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Since it has been agreed that the program is
      good enough to be retained, the issue is about the form in which you want
      to retain it. Ask yourself these questions -</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Must we continue with it this way?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Is there a better way to do it?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What do we stand to gain if we improve on
      it?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What do we stand to lose if we do not?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not believe the lie that it is already in
      its best state; nothing is yet in its perfect state. You can still spice
      it up. Carefully reassess the program, evaluate every of its processes,
      repackage it in order to make it better, and represent it to your
      followers. They will be grateful for the innovation.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is an advice to all youth leaders: If
      you cannot invent, improve. If you cannot think of new ideas, make better
      use of existing ones. Think of ways to do it better than it has ever been
      done. Become a yardstick for excellence and quality.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This way, you will be in the good records of
      the initiators of the program in the past administration who may not be
      happy with you if you scrap a good program. You will also have favor with
      your followers in this new administration who will appreciate a better
      packaged program. Both ways, it will be a plus to your administration.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. INVENT NEW PROGRAMS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not be satisfied with the old tricks. Try
      your hands on a few new ones. You do not have to repeat history or just
      maintain the status quo. Look for territories yet to be explored by past
      leaders. Be known for something significant. To get a different result
      from those who have gone ahead of you, you must either do something they
      did not do, or do something they did in a way they did not.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Take your time to discover what needs to be
      done in and for the group. To know what new projects to start with in your
      tenure, ask yourself this honest question: “What is the next major
      challenge that needs to be addressed now? What can I do that no other
      leader in this group has done before. Once discovered, take your time to
      accomplish it. By all means, make things happen.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What you need is one real idea and not
      multiple fantasies. Do not just chase white goose. Do not run after
      irrelevant projects. Save yourself the stress. Every plan you decide to
      undertake must be genuinely important. Direct all your energy and
      resources towards laudable projects that are relevant to members of your
      organization. Go after projects that will make noticeable difference in
      their lives. This will put your name on the roll call of the best leaders
      in the history of the organization.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In the past century, youths were not as
      demanding as they are today. They were satisfied with whatever little
      their leaders could offer. Now, youths expect more from their leaders, and
      like Oliver Twist, they will consistently ask for it until they get
      something worthwhile. Do not wait until they start demanding for what your
      administration will do. Be proactive. Offer them your best projects, and
      you will silence every opposition.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The youths of today have seen all manner of
      things. The social media, the internet, and the movie industry have
      exposed them to so much that most of them are really not thrilled by
      insignificant projects. So many of them are of the opinion that whatever
      is worth doing at all is worth doing well. So it takes much more than
      little projects to shut the mouths of such people. Therefore, attempt
      great things.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Man always achieves so little because he
      only attempts so little. If you attempt enormous projects you will achieve
      great feats. If you attempt something bigger, you definitely will achieve
      something greater. Do not limit yourself and your dream by the limited
      resources around you. Dream BIG and you will someday deliver it, BIG.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The choice of projects to embark on should
      transcend your desire for cheap popularity and fame. If what drives you is
      just image building, you will be satisfied with whatever little you are
      able to offer your followers. You will even expect that they celebrate you
      for whatever little success you have been able to accomplish, and may get
      offended if the accolade does not match up with your expectation. However,
      if your driving force</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">is a desire to leave the group better than
      it was when you meet it, accolade or not, you will not be distracted.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not be scared of entering unfamiliar
      territories. If what you desire is to take the organization higher, you
      will do what is uncommon. Do what has not been done before, and you will
      become famous.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">However, be careful. Never raise people’s
      expectation more than you should. Do not make promises you cannot keep.
      Rather than promise much more than you can deliver, and end up
      disappointing them, it is better to under-promise and over-deliver.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When you finally decide on what projects to
      pursue during your tenure; write them out. If you are like most premature
      youth leaders, you will find out you have more in your hands than you can
      possibly accomplish in three generations. So analyze the contents of the
      list and prioritize. Look for a major need and fill it. Watch out for one,
      two or three things that if well accomplished, will push the organization
      forward. Select two or three projects considered most important of all and
      list them in order of their importance. In that same order, these goals
      should be accomplished.</p>		
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="settings">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">To be their leader, you will need to
      determine how many challenging but reasonable projects you can
      realistically achieve during your regime. Do not aim at too many projects.
      Setting too many goals will make realizing your dream look seemingly
      impossible and you will end up disappointing those who have faith in you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may have a list of things that really
      need be done. However, you cannot do all of them in one tenure, especially
      with the scarcity of human and financial resources. They have to be in
      stages. Remember some areas of your life need your attention too. You
      cannot do everything the group needs in the brief period of time you have.
      So, concentrate on limited goals that will make a whole lot of difference.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not be a jack of all trades, master of
      none. Be involved in activities that have lasting impacts. Save your
      energy for a few targets so as to maximize your impact. It is better to do
      one thing wonderfully well than to do ten things with flaws and mistakes.
      So, just choose the ones you think they need most and will appreciate
      most.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Pick on the first one and set a deadline,
      say, a year. Break the project into two major parts, one for each half of
      the year. Further break each down to six and spread it over the six months
      in each half year. This breaks down the seemingly mountainous problem to
      sizable chunks which are easier for your followers to swallow. It will
      help, if possible, to further break it down to weeks, and then days.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">After this, assign each task to people whom
      you think can best handle it. If you, indeed, need to raise a committee
      for any, do not hesitate to. Do not just raise committees for the sake of
      engaging people. Uncommitted committees make tasks burdensome.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Paste this list beside your office table if
      you have one (or beside your bed at home), with the direct phone number of
      each youth to whom a task is assigned beside his name and the assigned</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">duty. This makes the list readily
      accessible. Keep in touch with each of them, if not every day but as
      occasion demands.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Let there be a clear cut definition of each
      person’s function. Let everyone know where he comes in, that is. who does
      what and when, so as to avoid stepping on each other’s toes. This will
      also enhance a smooth operation of the daily discharge of everybody’s
      respective responsibilities.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every youth who has a responsibility each
      day must be followed up personally. Call him in the morning to remind him
      of what he is supposed to do for the team. Do not just assume he will
      remember. He has a lot of other things to do with his time too. Youths
      generally do not take other people’s dreams as seriously as theirs, so
      your call will make a whole lot of difference. Call up each person
      attached to a task and let him know the place, time, and what exactly is
      expected of him.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Also try to send a text message to him just
      before the commencement of the assignment. This also will serve as a
      reminder. Lastly give him a call before the day runs out to ask how it all
      went. If he is a competent follower, he will come to you, or at least call
      you to discuss this. If he has not done this, you take the initiative to
      call him. The projects, though, for the good of all, is today seen as your
      project. So monitor it yourself. Your reward will someday surface.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Ask yourself at the close of each day “has
      my activity today moved me closer to my dream or further away from it”? A
      verbal answer will not be adequate. The list you have written earlier will
      serve as a scale on which to measure your progress.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, as resources will permit you, try as
      much as possible to conclude whatever project you start. Some projects
      that will only meet temporary needs might be urgent, but this should not
      be allowed to hinder the accomplishment of other projects that will meet a
      long term need. Attend to such urgent projects as time will allow and then
      go back to your main project. You may have so many limited resources:
      time, finance and manpower. This is why it is advisable not to run two
      major projects, concurrently. Finish one before you start the other. This
      will give you time to concentrate on the task at hand, focusing on it with
      all the available resources for maximum impact. You will find out that
      this will save you time and energy. Much more than this, the accomplished
      projects will serve as a source of motivation for both you and your
      followers to energize you to face the next project.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Starting well is not enough, finishing well
      is as important. Finish well by all means. There is no point starting well
      if you know you will not finish well. It is not over until it is over.
      Success is measured largely by how you finish. Success is much more about
      breasting the tape than it is about kick-starting early enough. Do your
      best to finish well.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Review your achievements from time to time. Look back at where you are coming from so you will know how far you have come. Do this together with your workforce and once in a while, share it with the rest of your followers. This will show them that you are making progress and this knowledge will solidify their trust in your ability.</p>
