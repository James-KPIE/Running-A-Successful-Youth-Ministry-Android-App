    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> RESPONSIBILITIES OF A YOUTH LEADER (3)</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Beside your responsibilities to the people
      who you are leading, your primary responsibility as a leader is first, to
      yourself. You cannot fulfill your responsibilities to others unless you
      have first satisfied your responsibility to yourself. So, it makes sense
      to know what your responsibilities to yourself are, and to attend to them
      before anything else.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>BUILD UP THEIR TRUST IN YOU</b><br>
      One thing you cannot do without is the ability to make people like you.
      This is crucial! Whatever the level of your managerial ability and
      management techniques, if your followers do not like you, you may not
      succeed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Today’s youths may not totally trust you or
      your sense of reasoning and judgment as readily and as much as you will
      desire. You will need to do all possible to build up the confidence you
      expect them to have in you. Do this one step at a time. This is necessary
      because if they do not love you, they cannot love your vision. They will
      have to accept you before they accept your plans, no matter how
      mouth-watering it may look.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> So, your first responsibility to yourself
      as a leader is to find a way to build up trust in your followers. Start up
      on this good note: win their hearts over. This will naturally increase the
      confidence your followers have in you. If you can win their hearts at the
      initial stage, you are likely to win their allegiance and support all
      through your tenure as leader. Youths are so easy to predict. If they love
      you; they love you. Even if you mistakenly misbehave, they are willing to
      overlook it, forgive you and embrace you back. If they hate you from the
      start, it will take some time for them to change their minds about you,
      even if you do the right things!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Your main point of focus here should be how
      to establish credibility and earn their trust. These may take a lot of
      outward expression of care, concern, patience, love, wisdom and the like.
      The extent to which they can trust you is the extent to which they will
      follow you. So, develop friendship skills with them now before it is too
      late, else, you will be deficient in your ability to relate with them and
      carry them along in your bid to lead aright, and this will greatly hamper
      your efficiency as a leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>UPGRADE YOURSELF</b><br>
      How much of what you are doing today do you really know? Can what you know
      about what you are doing move the group higher? If the answer is no, then
      upgrade yourself!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Those you lead will not respect your
      leadership if they think they know much more than you do! Who wants to be
      led by a</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										 <p style="text-align: justify;">fool? If your followers know far more than
      you, it is not likely they will be willing to follow you. You really may
      not be the most intelligent in the group you lead, but you really do not
      have to be the least. You must know, at least, more than an average member
      of the group, else you are not worthy to be called their leader.<br>
      The most interesting group of people to lead today is youths. The
      advancement in information technology has opened them up to a wealth of
      information. This information is readily available at their fingertips.
      They already have an idea about how well to do what you intend to do. If
      your approach to it is still crude and uncivilized, and you are not
      willing to learn, you will soon lose their allegiance to you. Two things
      which will readily help you in dealing with them are the information you
      have access to and the grace of God upon your life. These two will work
      hand in hand; the presence of one will not make up for the absence of the
      other.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> You will be tempted beyond
      measure to focus more on what you do, to the neglect of the new
      information and knowledge you should acquire. This, if allowed, will
      transmit into grievous consequences in the nearest future. Go for relevant
      up-to-date information so that you will not remain out-of-date. If you are
      not updated, you will be outdated in no time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Strive to know more than the people you
      claim to lead. Keep awake in the night to upgrade yourself. A wise man
      said: “If you sleep when your followers are sleeping, you soon will become
      one of the followers, and one of the followers will take your place”. Do
      not be a Martha who is always running around to see<br>
      that things fall in place. Be a Mary who will take out time to learn so as
      to improve herself.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> All over the world, big companies set time
      and allocate resources for the development of their managerial staff. They
      take them through trainings and seminars to get the best out of them. You
      will also need to develop yourself to remain the leader of the group you
      are leading. If you give continually without replenishing, you will soon
      exhaust yourself and whittle out.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Have a teachable spirit. You will not excel
      simply by desiring to. Learn! Sharpen your skills. Improve yourself. Learn
      more. Learn a little more. Learn some more. And then learn much more.
      Training gives rise to confidence. The more training you get the more
      confident you are to carry out your leadership responsibilities and the
      better you will be at it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Give yourself enough trainings as much as
      time will allow you: formal trainings, informal trainings, workshops,
      seminars, conferences, and other such personal development projects. Learn
      from books. Learn from other youths. Learn from good political leaders.
      Learn from religions leaders. Learn from your role models and learn from
      life itself.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> These trainings should not just be in the
      area of your strength alone, but also in the area of your weaknesses. It
      is natural to want to upgrade yourself in the area of your strength alone.
      Do not do this to the neglect of your weaknesses.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Every leader gravitates in the direction of
      their strengths, for that is where they get the best result and the
      loudest applause.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">However, upgrading yourself in the area of
      your weaknesses too will make you a balanced leader and your flaws and
      weaknesses will not be too pronounced to your followers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Always do this from time to time. There is
      no such thing as one-time-learning. The world is improving by the day,
      technology is advancing by the minute, and ideas are
      progressing rapidly. Do not be left behind. The longer you
      stay in the position of leadership, the busier you get, and the more
      exhausted you become. So, do not forget to build your self up from time to
      time so as to sharpen your leadership skill.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>BE COMMITTMENT TO YOUR OWN GOALS</b><br>
      A leader’s seriousness is determined by his degree of performance at the
      task assigned, irrespective of the challenges he has. Therefore, your
      commitment to your task must not be conditional. It must be without any
      limit.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Regardless of the number of the people you
      are leading, your followers deserve your best. Put in your best by being
      totally committed to the task before you. Do not expect any of your
      followers to be committed to your vision if you are not wholly committed
      to it yourself. Great leaders encourage other people’s commitment by their
      own commitment. Jim Rohn once quoted his mentor: “My mentor said “let’s go
      do it’, not “you go do it”. How powerful when someone says, “let’s”!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Be a role model for your followers by being
      the first to take the lead. What you are going to demand from them you
      must be ready to give yourself. If you demand honesty, be honest. If you
      demand fairness, be fair. If you demand openness, be open. If you demand
      commitment, be committed. If you demand<br>
      dedication, be dedicated. If you demand financial sacrifice, as much as it
      lies within your capacity, take the lead. It is tit for tat. Do not demand
      much from your followers if you are not ready to sacrifice much yourself.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Do not just give orders, participate.
      “Talk” is cheap. Anyone can talk, but not everyone will be willing to act.
      Do not just fold your hands, sit down and expect to be worshipped. Always
      take the lead in pursuing the primary goal at hand. Absolute commitment to
      the primary vision is the hallmark of any great leader. Throw all of your
      energy in the direction of your goal, and you will discover that others
      will follow, doggedly. Staying focused on your goal will make you more
      productive and keep your people tightly glued to you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> President Dwight Eisenhower once
      demonstrated this using a simple piece of thread thrown on a table. When
      he pulled it, it followed him everywhere he wanted, but when he pushed it,
      it went nowhere. In leadership, men are like strings. If you lead the way
      and pull them along, all or at least most follow suit, but if you push,
      you go alone.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> There will be enough distractions, but be
      faithful to your responsibilities. Being the kind of people they are, some
      youths may accuse you of selfish interests. Some higher authorities who do
      not understand why you do what you do may label you as an unserious
      leader, but be determined. Do not allow their baseless words distract you
      from achieving carefully laid down goals. If, before embarking on the
      project, you really take your time to deliberate on the actions and the
      challenges to expect, then see to its fulfillment. The end will justify
      the means.</p>

                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="settings">
										 <p style="text-align: justify;">To keep you away from some of these
      distractions, you will need undivided concentration. Some of the excuses
      of your distractors may be genuine; they all may not stem from a root of
      jealousy or envy. Some of them may come out of sincere love and concern
      for you and the projects you are handling. The problem, however, is that
      they may not be seeing from your own point of view and as such, are bound
      to disagree with your mode of operation.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> You may decide to bring such
      youths closer to you, dialogue with them and make them see reason with
      you. Rather than allow them to say all manner of things behind you and
      corrupt the other youths, you may decide to harmonize some of their
      thoughts with your common goals, as long as it does not affect your main
      dream adversely. If you can win them over, they will be a strong
      instrument to channel your course among the other youths.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This singular action, the process of
      winning to yourself the major opposition group among your youths, will be
      interpreted as good leadership that has the ability to handle the youths
      aright. You will score more points this way.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>BE A FOLLOWER</b><br>
      Although you are a leader, and you have a number of other followers who
      appreciate your leadership, in order to be a good leader, you also need to
      be a good follower. You need leaders who will lead you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Life is give and take. You have been giving
      out instructions by teaching and leading others, you also will need to
      take in. You need mentors to refill, not just mentors but experienced
      mentors.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> You need someone to constantly encourage
      and counsel you. You need someone you are answerable to. Without this, you
      being a leader, will be your own boss, without any checks and balances.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is imperative that you are accountable
      to someone. Look for leaders you want to be like and endeavor to develop a
      mentoring relationship with them. There is no substitute for superior
      experience. There are so many things you cannot afford to learn through
      personal experience. Your mentor can teach you those.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Listen to those who have more insight than
      you do. Keep close to those who are more successful than you are. Every
      new generation should be an improvement on the former. To achieve this,
      the new generation needs to move closer to the outgoing generation and
      observe the best of their leaders closely. Learn from their achievements
      and their failures. Listen to good advice from them and model the positive
      principles you see in them. Put serious effort into incorporating their
      leadership styles, godly values and essential qualities into your life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> During your moment of crisis, seek out help
      from other experienced and respected leaders around you. There is hardly a
      problem or challenge you encounter that someone has not already handled.
      Just look for the person and download the solution from him.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> More often than not, the people who you
      really desire to be your mentors may always be the busiest around, and
      will have little or no time for you. You can study their lives from afar
      and pattern your life after theirs. Study their materials. Very soon, you
      will become like them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> In following other leaders as your mentors,
      please bear in mind that someone else’ techniques may not always produce
      exactly the same results it produced somewhere else in another particular
      setting. People are not the same everywhere. Character, charisma,
      abilities and leadership qualities differ. If you want to introduce
      something which you learnt from a mentor to your followers, make sure it
      will be relevant to your people.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>BE YOURSELF</b><br>
      You may not find this last advice very encouraging; but you will need it.
      Be yourself. Do not try to impress your youths by being another person. If
      they wanted that person they would go for him. The person they want is
      you; that is why they have tabernacle with you. Do not deny them the
      person their hearts desire.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> There will always be a better way of doing
      things so that you can become a better you. Learn that better way without
      losing your personality. Become a better person but do not lose what makes
      you unique.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Youths listen to a lot of leaders apart
      from their own direct leaders. They will make recommendations to you. “Why
      don’t you dress like Mr. A, or talk like Mrs. B, or counsel like Dr. C, or
      walk like Prof. D?” There will always be a basis for comparison with
      another person. Make up your mind to only learn what you do not know and
      not to lose what you have.</p>
