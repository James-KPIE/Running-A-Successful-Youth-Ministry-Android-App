										<p style="text-align: center;">Chapter Sixteen</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">BEST OF LEADERS FOLLOW THE BEST LEADER EVER</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone knows that in order to be better at
      what you do, you need to learn from the best of teachers in
      that field. God is the best leader in the world. If you want to be a good
      leader to your youths, you have to do it hand in hand with Him.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The place of God in leadership cannot be
      overemphasized. He is the greatest leader. The best of leaders are those
      who follow God, the Best Leader Ever.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Leadership can be very easy when done with
      the assistance of God. On the other hand, it may be very tedious,
      monotonous and burdensome if the place of God is neglected.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a leader who really desires to succeed,
      you will need to spend time with the Master Leader on daily basis. The
      magnitude of the task at hand and the urgency of what needs to be done may
      make you feel there is no such time to seek Godâ€™s face daily. The huge
      pressures on every side and the limited time available will want to make
      it difficult for you to spare any extra time to want to do this. You must
      understand that the time spent with God is not wasted time. It is time
      rightly invested and will yield serious dividends in your favor, from time
      to time.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Never deny yourself an opportunity to
      commune with Him daily. So many things will compete with this time-out
      with Him. Once you allow any of such things to override His leadership
      over your life, your influence and leadership over the people will begin a
      downward surge, which you may never recover from until you find your way
      back to Him.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A number of other things may look adequate
      enough to displace God from your life; the degrees you have, your personal</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">experience, the quality of your friends and
      advisers, the integrity of your work force, the good name you have among
      the people, the impact your leadership has made on your followers in so
      short a time, the recommendations you have from other leaders, the
      financial resources you control, the authority and power at your disposal,
      and a whole lot of others. However, none of all these is strong enough to
      take the place of God, neither are all of these put together, strong
      enough to do the same.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Of all your responsibilities as a youth
      leader, either to yourself or to your followers, this is the most
      important and the most significant one; your ability to follow the Best
      Leader Ever. When you begin to follow God, it will help you in so many
      areas.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">GIVES YOU DIRECTION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So much has been said about the major
      functions of a youth leader, one of which is to give direction to his
      followers. What if the leader does not know which way to go? It becomes
      difficult to give the needed direction to the group. If he only depends on
      his five senses, or those of others, it is possible that he will mislead
      the group.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A leader who hears from God before taking
      actions will not find himself in this circumstance. God will, from time to
      time, give him direction on what to do and where to go.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a youth leader, your ability to seek
      Godâ€™s face regarding the projects at hand will save you from a lot of
      problems and challenges lurking in the future for you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">HELPS YOUR IMPERFECTIONS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">No one is perfect. Everyone has his own
      weaknesses which, though may not be obvious to all, but is best known to
      him, and to God, the Creator of all. Man may successfully hide his
      weaknesses from other men, but it makes no sense hiding it from the God
      who sees everything done in secret.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Leaders who go to God with their
      imperfections and weaknesses always receive help from Him. God can make
      all grace available if we trust Him to, but He does not interrupt until He
      is invited. Whatever situation you are passing through, God can help you
      out if you take it to Him.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a youth leader, anytime you discover
      areas of your life where you still have issues, it could be a very obvious
      weakness, imperfection, or sins that easily beset, rather than try to
      cover them up and pretend all is well, take them to God in prayer. He is
      able, abundantly able, to help you. He will give you beauty in exchange
      for your ashes.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">GIVES YOU DIVINE WISDOM</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not be surprised. You may get confused as
      a leader. This could happen at the Frustration Stage of leadership. It may
      look as though all hell is let loose at you. All your professionalism,
      experience, ability and capability seem to work against you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What you need at a time like this is not
      more of worldly knowledge. What you need is the wisdom of God. When the
      wisdom of God is released to you, you will know how to manage the
      seemingly impossible situation and God will be glorified through it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Such display of superhuman wisdom will earn
      you a lot of respect and honor from your followers. Remember the fame of
      King Solomon began to spread the moment he engaged this supernatural
      wisdom to find out who the real mother of the living and the dead babies
      were. It will do same for you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">SAVES FROM IMPENDING DANGERS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">God can also give you security beyond what
      law enforcement agents can do for you. He can save you from known and
      unknown impending dangers, if you trust Him to.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Youths could be naughty at times. Unknown to
      you, some may turn against you and decide to harm you. Besides the youths,
      other unseen forces may not be too pleased with the great work you are
      doing in the lives of these youths. They may get offended that you are
      saving destinies from the grip of hell and redirecting them to the kingdom
      of Godâ€™s dearest Son. For this reason, they may stage an attack. If you
      have God, they cannot succeed. God will see to it that you are divinely
      protected. He shall give His angels charge over you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">HELPS YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR DREAM</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At times, leaders bite much more than they
      can chew. They embark on such gargantuan projects that demand much more
      than they can ever raise, financially and otherwise. Then they get to the
      middle of it all and they are stuck; it becomes difficult to make progress
      and going back looks impossible.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At such times, for leaders who are willing
      to always allow the Best Leader to lead them, there is always a way out.
      Some unexplainable things just happen, and then progress becomes the only
      option. It could be that the Red Sea just parted, or the sun</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">just stood still. Whatever happens, help
      will surface at the nick of time. God may not come when He is needed, but
      He never comes late to those who place their trust in Him.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="settings">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">GIVES YOU STRENGTH</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There may be moments when you will be so
      tired, fagged out, and will just feel like giving up. This is because
      human strength is limited. At such times, you need much more than the
      energy one derives from a balanced diet or an energy drink. What you need
      is grace. This grace is only made available by God.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If at any point in time you feel the
      magnitude of the task at hand is about to drive you crazy, the solution is
      not to give up. If you have a relationship with God, simply look up to
      heaven and demand for grace to continue. He will strengthen you and help
      you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Even if you do not have a relationship with
      Him before now, if you turn to God today, He will save you, save your
      leadership, and save your organization. Simply bow your heart and invite
      Him into your life. Ask Him to forgive all your past sins. Request that He
      becomes your Lord, your Savior and your personal leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">He will do exactly as you have requested,
      and much more than that, He will accept you as one of His sons and you
      will have full access to every divine blessing that the Father in heaven
      bestows on His children on earth.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Congratulations! You will discover that from
      now on, a certain level of grace that was, before now, unknown to you will
      begin to operate in your life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">CONCLUSION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These are just some of the many benefits of
      submitting your leadership to the Best Leader ever. If you have not done
      so, this is the best moment to, so that your tomorrow can be better than
      your today.</p>
