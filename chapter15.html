    <h2 style="text-align: center;">CREATING BALANCES</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Your life needs your attention; give your
      life the attention it needs. Do not kill yourself for leadership sake. If
      you die, the best the youths will do is to name a memorial after you, and
      then you are forgotten in no time. Someone else will replace you and the
      job continues. So, for the sake of other followers who will still need a
      good leader like you in the nearest future, take care of
      yourself!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You need to live a balanced life. Balance in
      life is needed for successful leadership. This is the age of extremes, but
      you will need to learn how to maintain balances. The other aspects of your
      life should not just suffer because you are a leader. You will need to
      learn how to say no to some things. Most leaders do not know that each
      time they say ‘yes’ to anything that demands some part of their time, they
      need to say ‘no’ to some other things to which they previously said ‘yes’,
      so as to create a balance in their schedule. You may think that you have
      so much free time, but you do not have more than the average 24hours
      everyone has.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The ability to learn to say ‘no’ without
      feeling guilty is one virtue all leaders should have. If you keep saying
      ‘yes’ without learning how to say ‘no’, before you know it, you will
      overcrowd your life with activities without any free margin for yourself,
      and very soon, you will fizzle away.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you always feel fagged out or tired, it
      is time to take a serious look at your life and discover how to bring it
      back into balance. You may need to delegate some activities (flip back to
      the chapter on Delegating Responsibilities and read it again), say ‘no’ to
      some, and reduce the time allocated to others. Whatever you do, create
      space for yourself by creating some balance in your life. If you do not,
      other areas of your life, (for example, your family, career, academic,
      relationship with God) will suffer.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are five major areas of your life
      which you need to give serious attention to. Do all in your power to
      strike a balance between them all. All these five put together will enable
      you to create the necessary balance between your life and the demands of
      the leadership position.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. PROPER REST</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It will come to a time when, considering the
      weight of things yet undone, you will tend to become over-busy. Tremendous
      pressure from all angles which desire your personal attention may want to
      tear you apart. Irrespective of these pressures, take time out to rest.
      You will discover at the end of the day that you are more fruitful after a
      time of rest, than any other time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Youth leadership can be draining, especially
      with all of the pressures from all sides. Some of these include your
      education, your spiritual life, your social life, your relationships with
      loved ones, your personal daily routines, coupled with the leadership
      responsibility and the general expectations of your followers from you.
      Each day is exhaustive with its myriad of demands from all around you, and
      each of these demands striving to extract a portion of you.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">The demands of your office require a great
      deal of time, energy and commitment. You will need rest to reinvigorate.
      If you do not give yourself enough time to rest, you are abusing your
      body.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Many people do not have the physical
      strength to discipline themselves so as to create a time for their bodies
      to rest. This is not ideal. You are not a robot. You are human. Make rest
      and relaxation a priority.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Learn to do what you must do today and you
      will be able to do what you want to do for long. If you deny yourself of
      the natural refreshment that only sleep can bring, you will leave before
      your time, and someone else who may not be as good as you are will carry
      on with your assignment</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Take siestas. You need to. Give yourself
      time for good sleep. You do not have to sleep ten hours per night if you
      do not have to. Whatever time you devote to sleep per night, sleep
      qualitatively. Take all worries away from your mind when it is time to
      sleep; worry kills. The little time you have to sleep, sleep like a baby.
      It will help you to achieve more when you are awake.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone needs good sleep. To oscillate
      between all of these responsibilities without adequate rest periods can
      lead to leadership imbalance. You will become emotionally unstable and
      physically spent.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There must be a work-leisure balance. Being
      busy is not synonymous with being fruitful. Being active does not really</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">mean you are productive. Set your priorities
      right. You must be disciplined enough to say no to unproductive
      activities. This will need some courage as you must be prepared to
      disappoint some people.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Leadership is not just about sitting in the
      office, having hours of unending meetings and processing papers. It is
      about making things happen, especially the more important and more
      significant things. To make these things happen you need a cool brain, a
      relaxed mind and renewed energy.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The period of rest is the period for renewal
      of energy and strength. You will be more useful to the generation you are
      serving and the one to come if you take time out to rest than if you do
      not. He who rests, lasts. If you do not take time out of your busy
      schedule to rest today, you will be forced to rest someday, when sickness
      knocks you down.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not let your busy schedule in the office
      cause you to forget your sleep or neglect your bed. You are mortal, and
      there is a limit to what you can do. This is not to encourage slothfulness
      in leadership. Only magicians with modernized magic wand can do the
      impossible in this jet age. However, anyone, yourself inclusive, can make
      possible the impossible by simply giving it your best. Give it your best
      shot, but find time to rest.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You will not impress anyone by simply being
      a ‘workaholic’ leader. They hardly notice your sleeplessness, and if they
      do, they do not appreciate it as long as it does not bring commensurate
      progress to the organization. Worse still, it really does not make the job
      any easier, neither does it make your leadership more acceptable.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. PROPER EXERCISE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once-a-week exercise will help you to
      alleviate the stress accumulated over the week. This weekly exercise, to a
      great extent, will help you control your stress level. When the stress
      level is unchecked, your health is threatened and your effectiveness, as a
      leader, is challenged.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Find a hobby; it may stretch your nerves.
      Balance your intensive workload with leisure activity. The more
      responsibility leaders get, the more they neglect the care of their body.
      Take good care of your body and you will be too grateful when it begins to
      reward you. It will have a positive effect on your soul and spirit.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you can afford it, register in a gym or
      get a physical health instructor who will attend to you at home, weekly.
      If you cannot afford any of that, engage yourself in the normal Saturday
      morning workouts. An early morning jug, a number of press-ups, sit-ups,
      some minutes on the mill or with the skipping rope and the like, will save
      your body from deterioration and put you in good shape.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. PROPER STUDY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are not a student, this may not
      affect you seriously.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Student leadership is time consuming and
      energy sapping; do not expect to have an easy time at it. Most students do
      not know this until they get involved in it. It is always much more
      demanding than they expect.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										 <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why many students who have the
      opportunity to lead other students always have this problem. They do not
      have as much time as they should have for their academics.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You will hardly have time to study, but it
      is important to make out time to study. Your books need your attention.
      Find the time to attend to it by all means. You are a student. Never stop
      being a student.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Many students may see your position as one
      of privilege and honor, secretly desiring the post, but only the head that
      wears the crown knows that “uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.”</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For more on how to excel as a student, you
      should get the author’s books titled “Secrets Of Successful Students” and
      “How To Boost Your GP”.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. PROPER DIET</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Take care of yourself. Eat well. You cannot
      just be expending energy without replenishing it or else you will soon be
      depleted. In order to replace the energy dissipated in carrying out your
      official functions as a leader, you will need a very balanced diet.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may not have the time to cook; you
      rarely will anyway, but you do not really have to. There are good
      restaurants all around nowadays. Once in a while, give yourself a good
      treat at any of the big eateries around. It will do your system a whole
      lot of good.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not subject yourself to one particular
      type of food every day. The temptation to do this is so high that so many
      leaders do not</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">know when they fall for it, either because
      the food is the most readily available or affordable. If you do this, you
      will deny your body system the nutrients it needs to function properly. It
      may not break down the same month you start doing it, but the day it
      decides to, you will discover that there is nothing as good as eating good
      food and being in good health, and that the pain to get a good plate of
      food thrice a day is preferable to the pain of being injected with
      syringes and drips.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Be careful what you eat, discipline your
      body. Do not just take junks. Balance your diet. Ordinary primary school
      health science teaches clearly that there are six classes of food:
      protein, vitamin, carbohydrate, fats and oil, mineral salt and water. Make
      sure they are all represented in your food daily.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. PROPER COMPANION</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You will need to create time for your
      intimate relationships. It may look as though the only important people in
      your life now are your followers. Remember that some people were in your
      life before you became a leader, and if you do not die in the leadership
      position, you will still need them back in your life. Do not allow the
      demands of your leadership position make you deny them of your
      companionship when they should have it.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="settings">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are married, create time for your
      wife and children. Your wife may understand your busy schedule, but your
      children will be too young to understand. They have no other father to act
      in your stead, so you must be ready to attend to them whenever they need
      the attention of their father.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are not married, give attention to
      your partner. Do not let her back off the relationship on the account of
      your lack of</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">attention for her. Also, create time for
      your immediate family: your father, mother, sisters and your brothers.
      They probably have not served as a youth leader before and so will not
      appreciate that the reason why they cannot have your attention is because
      you have some new people in your life who have stolen your heart away from
      your family.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">PLAN YOUR TIME</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To get all of these things done, you will
      need to be fully in charge of your time. Youth leadership requires a lot
      of time, energy and physical resilience. It will definitely impact your
      health, relationships, academics &amp; ambition either positively or
      negatively, all depending on the way you handle it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">No matter how busy you are, find time for
      yourself. Even the president of the greatest nation on earth has time for
      himself. Plan your time so that you will have time for all you have to do.
      Being busy is not the same as working. Filling time is not the same thing
      as time management. Being a workaholic is not an efficient way of using
      time. It is very easy to get too busy to be effective! You may not believe
      this until you get there.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Guard your time jealously. Do not let
      irrelevant, unscheduled, appointments encroach into your time
      unnecessarily. What is urgent may not be important and what is important
      may not be urgent. When you place each where it belongs, you will have
      more time for your life. Begin to value your time so much that you want to
      keep some for yourself. Until you value your time this much, you will not
      do anything with it for yourself. You will only work for the progress of

    <p style="text-align: justify;">AN IDEAL DAY FOR A YOUTH LEADER</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. Start your day with prayers. You will
      achieve more by starting up with God.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. Write out a list of things you want to
      accomplish in the course of the day. This list is called “to-do-list”.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. Rewrite them in order of importance or
      according to their scale of preference.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. If you are a student, separate at least
      an hour to go through your school notes, review past lectures, and finish
      up your practical and assignments. This brief revision early in the
      morning will help you a lot since you may be very busy during the day, and
      your concentration level will not be as high as in the mornings.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. If you are not a student, use this time
      to read a personal developmental book so as to add some value to your
      life, on daily basis.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">6. Make calls or send text to everyone who
      in one way or the other will contribute to the success of your day. This
      text or call will remind them of your expectations from them in case they
      have forgotten. These will include</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(i) Team members who have been assigned some
      responsibilities to be carried out on that day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(ii) The people you intend to meet with
      during the course of the day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(iii) Other leaders you may need to get
      something from during the course of the day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(iv) Any other appointments you may not want
      to miss.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">7. Do your toiletries and your household
      chores (bathing, washing, ironing, cleaning, eating)</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">8. Go to your office to attend to your
      office work. (Go for lectures if you are a student)</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">9. Set out for appointments that fall into
      the office/school period, with proper permission from your boss in the
      office or the lecturers, but try to avoid this as much as possible. Every
      appointment that you must attend to during the day should be scheduled at
      your free period in school or lunch time in the office.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">10. Eat and rest after office/school hours.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">11. Attend to other appointments till
      evening.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">12. Take timeout to read something, either
      meaningful or just entertaining. You may also play some games or watch a
      movie. Just find a way to relax.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">13. Have your dinner.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">14. Go to bed.</p>
