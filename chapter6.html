										<p style="text-align: center;">Chapter Six</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> BUILD A SOUND WORKFORCE</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Your workforce, literally means the human
      force you work with. They are the workers available for any or all of your
      operations.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> From the definition above, your workforce
      will include those who work hand in hand with you. They serve as your key
      leaders, youth executives, managerial team, planning committee or
      implementation board. These are people in whose hands the success of your
      leadership directly depends. They run your programs, oversee your
      projects, and sit with you to take crucial decisions on all relevant
      matters. These are the ones to whom you designate some vital aspects of
      your responsibility and authority. They are those who make things happen
      for you. Without them, there is a limit to the success you can make,
      irrespective of your plans and your efficiency.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Many good people with good intentions have
      gotten to leadership positions and fumbled simply because they did not
      have the right set of people to work with. This is because leadership is
      not a one man show; it is a collective drive. If you have this right
      perspective of what a workforce is, it will help you choose the right
      personnel for the specific tasks at hand.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Nothing builds up a winning team like
      putting the right people in the right place. You do not have to put only
      your choice friends or closest colleagues in positions that matter. It may
      generate a negative reaction from other youths. Apart from the crisis it
      will cause within the group, you will not also enjoy the best service from
      them, since they are not rightly qualified for the position they occupy.
      When it comes to choice of leaders, team members or executives, you should
      be more interested in functions and abilities, than relationships and
      friendships.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Most times when youths meet to take serious
      decisions, they spend hours on end without reaching a conclusive end, and
      most times have to postpone the meeting to a later time. This is because
      the configuration of the people at the meeting differs; hence their
      differing opinions. If there is a common goal, with a common focus, and a
      common drive, meetings need not take eternity before decisions are made.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Your choice of co-leaders should be youths
      who share common core values with you. They should be limited to people
      you can relate with in unity. If you do otherwise, your executive meetings
      will be filled with hot arguments and serious debates. You will always
      find it difficult to reach an agreement.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Since you do not share the same views, it
      will be pretty hard to come to a consensus on issues, points of value will
      always differ, interests will differ, and pursuits will differ. Every
      issue discussed will be seen like the case of the half-filled cup. Some
      will want to jump at the offer of the half-filled cup while the other
      party will detest the opinion of considering the acceptance of the half
      empty cup. One side sees the filled half; while the other side sees the
      empty half.<br>
      Life is like this! While some people praise God for roses in the midst of
      their thorns, others complain bitterly of thorns in the midst of their
      roses. Perceptions differ! You will save yourself a whole lot of stress if
      you choose people with whom you see eye-to-eye on, if not all issues, at
      least, majority of them. Select people with common goals, principles,
      ideas, and purposes so as to have a cooperate effort.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The projects you want to undertake will be
      one of the major deciding factors to consider in choosing your workforce.
      This is because projects succeed or fail because of the people involved.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> After highlighting what you want to achieve
      in your tenure in office, ask yourself: “Who do I need to make this
      happen?” It is important to have an accurate and detailed answer to this
      simple question above as it will aid you guard against a lot of errors
      which many other leaders before you have made.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> You will need to choose people who have
      gifts and talents which are relevant to your projects so that their gifts
      can be useful for the progress of the group. Answer this question for each
      step you have highlighted. If you can find the correct answer to this
      question for each step of the way, your job becomes simplified and things
      naturally begin to happen around you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The ‘whom’ you do ‘what’ with is as
      important as the ‘when’. The ‘what’ and the ‘when’ may be right, but until
      the ‘whom’ is right, progress will not be recorded. Great leader always
      know when to do what and with whom. Formally or informally, screen
      eligible youths for each position and see to it that only those who are
      qualified enough get to the place of authority as co-leaders with you.
      This is very important because the choice of your co-leaders will
      determine, to a large extent, your success in the office.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<p style="text-align: justify;"> Spend time with your workforce. It takes
      playing together, chatting together, arguing together and robbing minds
      together to learn how to think together, and with time, reason alike, for
      the good of the organization.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Let your battery charge the battery of
      other people. Make a deposit into their lives. There is no success without
      a successor. These are the ones who will carry on your dream long after
      you are gone. If it happens that the leadership baton changes hands and
      you are no longer opportune to lead them, it is very possible that the
      leadership baton will be handed over to one of those whom you have raised.
      These ones will see to the successful completion of the projects which you
      initiated but unable to complete. This will make your leadership impact
      transcend generations to come.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If they are not in the new leadership, but
      are still in the youth group, the new leadership will find it difficult to
      stop them from continuing the projects you started as long as they are
      relevant. You raised them, and they owe you the privilege to see your
      dream come true.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Plant seeds in everyone; someday they will
      germinate, and you will reap from them. Teach them all you wished your
      predecessor had taught you while in office. Great success without a good
      successor is a great failure. It is these ones you groomed who will carry
      on your legacy at the end of your term in office. If you teach them well,
      you will have no fear if one of them finally succeeds you when your tenure
      is over. You will be relaxed; rest assured that the projects you started
      are in safe hands.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is possible to discover some people who
      know much more than you in certain areas. This is one of the ironies of
      life. You do not have to compete with them. Do not envy them, rather,
      employ them. Enlist them in your workforce, and silently learn from them
      until you have known what they know (that is if you think you will need
      the knowledge later on in life).</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Do not be threatened by their knowledge.
      Welcome varieties of gifts and talents. Intentionally look out for and
      engage people who are smarter than you are, or who have capacities to
      become better than you, if well trained, and invest in. If you can invest
      in their lives, their personal development will propel the development of
      the organization.</p>
    <h2> UNDERSTANDING THE STAGES OF YOUTH LEADERSHIP</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> During your tenure as a leader, no matter
      how long or how short, no matter how committed you are to serving your
      followers, you will experience three different stages.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Every leader, good or bad, has passed
      through these stages in the past and none has been able to stay on just
      one of the three, permanently. You also will continually move from one of
      these stages to another. Your efficiency per time will depend on how you
      react during each of these stages.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> These three stages of leadership are not
      peculiar to leaders leading the youths alone. They are common to all
      leaders. So, do not begin to think that running away from the youth
      ministry will save you from them. Knowing how to handle well each stage
      will prepare you for the future challenges of leadership at a higher cadre
      when the time comes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>1. THE ENTHUSIASTIC STAGE</b><br>
      This is the stage when so much progress is made in so little a time. Your
      enthusiasm is at its peak. Your follower’s excitement is unequalled. Their
      zeal is plentiful and the energy is robust. Everything you want done is
      carried out to specifications without any delay and with little or no
      opposition.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This is the most enjoyable period for any
      leader. Everyone around him cooperates for his success. Things fall in
      their rightful places of their own accord. Opportunities to make very
      visible impact on his followers open up by themselves and one always leads
      to the other in quick successions. It is a period of heaven on earth for
      every leader. He is liked by his followers, supported by his work force,
      appreciated by other leaders, celebrated by his colleagues, and encouraged
      by higher authorities.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Any leader who starts at this stage will
      feel that youth leadership is as easy as drinking a bottle of soft drink
      with plastic straw. If this is what leadership is all about, no leader
      will have problems with his followers. This is just one of the three
      stages of leadership.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This is the best time for any leader to
      make necessary impact on his organization. Every little effort attracts
      great results. During this stage, each of his impacts is amplified by
      supernatural forces to produce unending results. Wise leaders maximize
      this period by using it to pursue their best projects.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The unpalatable news is that this stage, as
      much as every leader will desire it to, is not always permanent; it fades
      out sooner than people expect. So, if you find yourself in this stage in
      your leadership quest, make the best of it. Do all you have to now that
      the people are willing to yield to each of your impulses. They are ready
      to follow if only you are ready to lead aright.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Give your best projects supreme priority
      during this period. Whatever you cannot achieve during this stage, you
      probably may not be able to achieve at any other phase.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>2. THE ROUTINE STAGE</b><br>
      This is the stage where not too much progress is made, although everything
      is functioning smoothly. Things go as planned, but not too much
      improvement is recorded. It is more of a constant flat terrain experience
      unlike the enthusiastic stage where skyrocketing achievements are the
      order of the day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Of a fact, things are not really as easy at
      this stage, but it is not also that difficult. It is just that the people
      are not as cooperative as they used to be. They give so many excuses for
      not doing what is expected of them and they are not very excited about you
      and your dream. The excuses they give though will be justifiable. They are
      busy with office work, they have pressure at the home front, they need
      time to settle some pressing needs, they are preparing for an exam, and
      others too numerous to highlight here.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> They still like you, at least they try to
      wear a smile each time they see you from afar, and they still give you a
      warm embrace each time they have the opportunity to get closer, but they
      now have more precious things to do with their time than running
      helter-skelter with another man’s dream.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> At first, you may begin to insinuate that
      it is because they heard some bad or untrue news about you, or that your
      enemies have won them over. After a careful research, you will discover
      that no one is really at the root of this. They are just being human.</p>	
										</div>
										<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										<p style="text-align: justify;"> Deciding to confront them is encouraged but
      you must know that it may not yield any change because they all have
      reasonable and tenable excuses to give for not rallying round you or
      running with your projects as they used to. Whatever excuse they give, you
      will be handicapped.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> With wisdom, every leader can still
      successfully cope during this stage. Since you still have their allegiance
      and support, you have no problem. What they have only denied you is their
      100% commitment, like before. So, it really is no serious problem.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> All you need to do is to accept the little
      commitment they have to offer at this stage and keep encouraging them to
      do more. It is not the time to chastise them or send nasty messages to
      them. It is not the time to “let them know the stuff you are made of”,
      neither is it the time to “show them your other side”. It simply is the
      time to cope with the best they are willing to offer and allow them attend
      to whatever it is they need to attend to. Life is not a bed of roses. The
      tide will soon change, and tomorrow, you may be back at the enthusiastic
      phase.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Leaders whose first experience is the
      enthusiastic stage may begin to think that the change in the attitude of
      the followers is as a result of something they used to do which they no
      longer do. If you discover that there were things you stopped, you are
      encouraged to retrace your steps. However, do not be too disappointed if
      this does not bring the result you expect. Their reaction to you is not
      because of what you stopped, it is because no condition is permanent in
      life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Leaders whose first experience is this
      stage may have to pray for grace to cope.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>3. THE FRUSTRATION STAGE</b><br>
      This is the most difficult and the only almost unbearable period of
      leadership. It is a stage most leaders do not pray to experience. It is
      characterized by frustrations and turmoil. This is the time you attract
      the greatest degree of stresses and strains. You come face to face with
      the very low experiences of leadership.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> At this stage, the level of commitment from
      your people begins to dwindle drastically and their cooperation whittle
      fast away with time. Those who were very supportive before will turn their
      backs on you, or at worst, keep away from you completely. They will not
      want to have anything to do with you anymore, and they will not hide it.
      They will not pick your calls, they will turn down your invitations, avoid
      you as much as possible, and shun everything that has to do with you. It
      is even possible that you will begin to get criticisms from those who were
      loyal to you in the past.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> During this stage, your influence on the
      group will gradually become limited by the day, and some people may
      secretly begin to gang up against your leadership. Those who know your
      secrets, and who used to serve as your backbones may even turn against you
      and worse still, teach others to do the same. It is a period of betrayals.
      The progress of projects slows down almost to a crawl and things will no
      longer as planned. It is the direct opposite of the enthusiastic stage.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> At this stage, the leader will constantly
      face pressure from almost all angles. It will look as though he was not
      the same leader who was being celebrated a while ago. The same things he
      did which earned Him accolades a while ago, now begin to attract
      condemnation. Decisions that seemed so right before, now seem so wrong.
      Followers begin to lose confidence in him. They no longer will appreciate
      his noticeable efforts and commendable dedication.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="settings">
										
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is not uncommon for procrastination to
      seep in at this moment. Things which you did with utmost urgency and all
      enthusiasm now become things you put off indefinitely. Your productivity
      and your efficiency rate take a decline on the graph of your performance.
      There is no longer any source of motivation<br>
      This is a very discouraging stage for any leader. At this phase, it is
      likely that depression will set in for an inexperienced leader. The leader
      soon begins to lose his fire and passion. The enthusiasm, attraction and
      the thrill are gone. Doubts, fear, rejection, insecurity, and a host of
      other negative emotions flood in. He loses focus and his faith is about to
      waver. It is a period of exhaustion, confusion and discouragement. He sits
      down and watches the organization he built over the years crumble before
      his very eyes. It is a bitter experience for leaders. During this stage,
      leaders begin to have a miserable feeling which often leads to self-pity.
      Far too often, they begin to question their own ability, capability,
      experience and professionalism.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If this stage is not well handled,
      self-depreciation begins to set in. This is dangerous as it can degenerate
      into low self-esteem and inferiority complex, both of which can hinder
      their effectiveness. If you are not truly a man, you will, almost, be
      forced to the resignation phase. You will begin to nurse negative feelings
      about yourself. Thoughts like; “maybe I really should not be the leader
      here”, “maybe I am not capable enough”, or “maybe I do not have what it
      takes” will begin to flood your mind. At this stage, the urge to quit will
      be the dominating thought of weak-willed leaders. However, this stage,
      like other stages, is not permanent. It is a phase that will soon fade
      away, bringing in again the enthusiastic stage.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> So many things may be responsible for this
      period, the chief of which is a wrong decision by the leader. Youths are
      predictable. One wrong decision can turn them all against you, just as one
      right decision can make all of them flock around you like chicken round
      mother hen. This is why you need to be careful about the decisions you
      make and the advice you take. If you refuse to take just one right step at
      the right time, you may pay with a thousand steps later in life</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Once you find yourself at this stage, the
      first question to ask yourself is “Where did I go wrong? The answer to
      this question will not be farfetched. If you carefully examine your
      immediate actions in recent times, just at the beginning of this stage of
      your leadership, you will be able to trace the source of the challenge you
      are facing.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you are unable to place your hands on
      any, you can talk to those you trust among your followers; enquire from
      them the reason for the change in their attitude to you. No matter how
      corrupt their minds are, at least one of them will be willing to share
      with you what the real problem is. This is why it is advisable to call
      them individually and not address them as a group. That way, you will find
      out more truths than you will in a public meeting. You may even be able to
      handle some of the issues raised privately at individual levels rather
      than allow someone expose the skeleton in your cupboard before the general
      assembly.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Once you discover what the issue is, then
      your problem is over. Take the necessary step to put things straight. If
      you need to apologize, please tender a sincere apology. If you need to
      loosen your grip on an opinion, please relax your nerves. If you need to
      revert on a decision, be quick to press the reverse gear. This will bring
      you back to the enthusiastic stage faster than you think. You will gain
      back the allegiance and the support of your followers one more time, and
      you will be glad you did.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Irrespective of the precautions
      you take, this stage will still come. The precautions cannot stop it from
      materializing; it can only reduce its duration and minimize its effect on
      you and the group at large.</p>
