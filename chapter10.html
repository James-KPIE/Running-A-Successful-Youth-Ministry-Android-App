    <h2 style="text-align: center;">CONFLICT MANAGEMENT SKILLS</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To be successful as a leader, you need to
      learn conflict management skills. Great skills will be required to handle
      your followers, especially the troublesome ones, particularly during the
      time of crisis.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Settling quarrels and disputes is about
      reconciliations with friends and re-establishing relationships. It is
      about resolving issues and not dissolving relationship. Sharing blames
      most times will dissolve relationship.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Each misunderstanding and disagreement must
      be addressed at an accurate time. Each crisis should be attended to in a
      timely manner. Timely in this sense does not only mean urgency, although
      at times, this may be the case, but some cases may require time; give such
      time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">At times, chastisement may be necessary, and
      where this is the case, wisdom must be applied. Manage every conflict
      confidently and constructively; do not be defensive.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">SETTLING DISPUTES BETWEEN PARTIES</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">From time to times, you may find yourself in
      a position of settling disputes or managing crisis between two followers.
      There are five major steps to take before taking any action in this
      regard:-</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. HEAR BOTH PARTIES OUT</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Never base your judgment on the narration
      from one of the two parties involved; this will make you a partisan leader
      and thus</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">can devalue the respect you enjoy with the
      youths. Even if you have an interest to protect, either in the case under
      investigation or in one of the parties involved, you do not have to make
      it obvious. Get detailed information of events from all of the parties
      involved without being unnecessarily or hastily judgmental.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. HEAR THEIR WITNESSES</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If need be, hear their witnesses too. No one
      in his right senses will narrate a story that will implicate him. It is
      natural that the stories of all of the parties involved will be so
      polished that it may be difficult to pin any offence on any of them by
      simply listening to their narrations alone. They would have buried the
      unsatisfactory part and would only emphatically pronounce the side of the
      story that portrays them as saints. The essence of this, either
      intentionally or not, is to derail you. It is natural; nobody likes being
      condemned. This is why you need more information - something more than
      what the hurting parties are willing to divulge; and the witnesses are
      your best bet.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. ASK QUESTIONS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Thirdly, ask questions. After listening to
      all the stories, you surely will have some contrasting facts for which
      clarifications will be needed. For such, ask relevant questions that will
      expose the true situation.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. PONDER THOUGHTFULLY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Ponder thoughtfully on the information you
      have gathered. Re-examine the stories and try to understand the issues at
      hand. Do not be in a hurry to resolve the issue or to condemn anyone.
      Examine the responses to your questions until you are sure you</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">have an understanding of the complexity of
      the situation at hand.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. SETTLE THE DISPUTE AMICABLY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly settle the dispute amicably. Except
      there is a guiding law in the organization that says such offences must be
      punished, do not give any punishment. Remember, it is just a
      misunderstanding between two followers, and not a serious crime. Take no
      serious disciplinary action. Treat everyone fairly. Learn to identify the
      problems without accusing anyone. Always seek to be a reconciler in such
      situations. Let those who are right know they are, and those who are wrong
      know as well without condemning any of the parties involved. Your
      intention should be to settle the dispute and not to rekindle it. So,
      handle the situation with care. If you need to condemn the erring party,
      you can do that at a later time, and in the absence of others, when the
      issue has subsided. If you must discipline or chastise, do it
      compassionately, with all honesty and with no hidden motives.</p>

                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">SETTLING PERSONAL DISPUTES</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Described above is the manner in which you
      can settle disputes between two followers. It is also possible that the
      crisis maybe between you and one of your followers, or may even be between
      you and the totality of the youth body. Such a crisis must be carefully
      handled so that it does not degenerate further as this can lead into a
      breakdown of law and order.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you ever find yourself in a situation
      such as that, do not let others discover and reveal your faults before you
      admit them. You are not a god. If you cover up your mistakes and they get
      to discover later from other sources, they may become disappointed in you.
      Detecting your own faults and admitting</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">them openly before those who need to know
      (and not just every Jack and Harry) will save you open disgrace and the
      public embarrassment that will follow if your followers discover, on their
      own, what you are trying to cover up. Be very open.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not fight to, unnecessarily, cover up
      your mistakes. If you cover your own mistakes, how do you intend to talk
      about those of others? Be honest. Let them know you are human and,
      therefore, prone to error. If, in all sincerity, you are at fault, admit
      it. Accept your mistakes. You will also gain more respect from the people
      you are leading.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than acknowledge their faults, some
      leaders will try to cover up their inefficiency by blaming others for
      their actions. Never blame another for the problem you caused. If you keep
      blaming others for your failures, you are likely to keep insisting that
      you are right. This way, you will not see the need for personal
      development.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Take responsibility for your actions and
      your decisions. Do not try to shift the blame onto others and do not try
      to hide it from them. Admitting your errors shows you are ready to learn.
      And that is the hallmark of a good leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Demonstrate courage during such time of
      adversity. There will always be a time of crisis. If you breakdown at such
      times, it shows you are not man enough.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">DEALING WITH INSULTS</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some youths (your followers), because of the
      age and time that we are in, lack good home upbringing and so, do not have
      good morals. Some of them can speak rebelliously to their parents.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some can even shout their parents down and
      hurl insults at them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are lucky enough (or rather, unlucky)
      to have some of them among your followers, you will need to handle them
      with care. Someone who does not see anything wrong with screaming at his
      parents will not see anything wrong with insulting a mere youth leader who
      he feels needs to be corrected.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are so many issues which we have no
      control over. These include the tone of the voice of our followers when
      they are annoyed, the style of presentation of their arguments, their
      gesticulations and the likes. Although we may not be able to control their
      actions, we should be able to control our own reactions. How we respond to
      their accusations, their presentation notwithstanding, will go a long way
      to determining whether we are mature leaders or not.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Accept insults in good faith. This is not to
      encourage the youths to abuse you at will or to take you for granted. It
      is because you have to keep the unity of the body in mind. This is one of
      the sacrifices you will need to make. The unity of the group you are
      called to lead is more important than your personal ego.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is why you are advised to be careful
      not to intentionally do anything that may give any of the youths the
      freedom to insult you. Youths too are human, and are bound to be very
      volatile when angered. So, tread gently.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Conversely, no matter how gently you tread,
      some bad eggs among them will still step on your toes. If you are a youth
      leader, considering the fact that the age difference between you</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">and your followers in most cases will not be
      that much to warrant a high degree of respect, such occurrences cannot be
      found wanting, and some devil-inspired youths are waiting for such moments
      to take the advantage, so as to spite you. Your ability to handle such
      situations maturely will be proof of the type of leader that you are.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If any of the youths you are leading
      annoyingly insults you publicly in a moment of rage, whether you are the
      cause of his infuriation or not, be willing to control yourself, overcome
      your pride and swallow the reproach. It is not a time to begin to flex
      muscles or exchange insults openly. You do not have to prove that you are
      the leader by serving him back in his own plate. You prove you are the
      leader by being cool, calm and collected. Believe me; it takes a whole lot
      of maturity to do this.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Avoid being abusive. Never respond
      emotionally or prematurely to situations. Learn not to get upset easily.
      Do not let the situation dictate your emotion; you control the situation.
      Every baseless critical comment aimed at you should be waved aside. If you
      concentrate much on your critics’ complaints, you will become destabilized
      and will lose concentration on the major task at hand. Irrespective of
      what happens, never lose control of your emotions. Be calm always. Never
      raise a hand at anyone: to slap, beat, or exchange blows. Control
      yourself.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some of these youths, unknown to you, might
      have tried other means to get at you without much success, and this
      opportunity is what they have been waiting for, to abuse your office and
      drag your name in the mud. Most of the unkind words they will use are not
      spontaneous! They have rehearsed them over and</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">over again in the privacy of their rooms,
      and they know what next to say to each reaction to their accusations.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you react to their emotional display the
      way you naturally should, your reaction will be unplanned and impromptu.
      Since they already have a game plan, you will fall into their traps. So,
      keep your reactions under check.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">All they want to do is disrespect you and
      cause you to misbehave in the presence of other youths so they may have
      something tangible against you. Disappoint them. Be calm. Accept the
      insults in good faith. Never be instigated to raise your voice, exchange
      words, or lift your hands against them. If you do, you will spoil more
      things before you realize it.</p>

										<p style="text-align: justify;">The initial reaction will be to feel
      disappointed, depressed and discouraged. You may even be tempted to feel
      annoyed and embittered. It may even be a mixture of these two reactions -
      sadness and madness. No matter how you feel, do not allow your emotions to
      get the better of you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not foment trouble. Do not intentionally
      provoke crisis. Whatever excuse you have for causing trouble will not be
      in your best interest at the end of the day. You will regret ever doing
      it. Without activating any more problems to yourself, you certainly will
      have enough of them on your hands. Each leader has his fill of crisis
      without looking for it. Why ask for more? Avoid all avoidable troubles.
      Only confront the few that cannot be avoided.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You may want to address the issue of respect
      and manners, but this will achieve better results if it is done at a later
      time, and not</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">in this meeting. If you feel a particular
      youth is doing this, as you leave the place of the meeting, you may
      consider reporting such to the appropriate quarters for adequate
      disciplinary measures to be taken so that it will serve as a lesson for
      others who may want to tow his line.</p>
