										 <p style="text-align: center;">Chapter Five</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">QUALITIES OF A GOOD LEADER</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Described in this chapter are those
      characteristics that are commonly found in a good leader. If you are a
      good leader, you will discover that most of them are already operating in
      your life. However, if you find out that none of them is obvious in your
      life, then you may need to change your ways and strive to become a better
      leader than you are.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>HUMILITY</b><br>
      In your relationship with your youths, show some level of humility. Being
      their leader today is just a privilege. It is not by your expertise,
      experience or professionalism. You are the leader today, any of them can
      be the leader tomorrow. So, exhibit qualitative character traits.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not look down on anyone in your team.
      Most leaders are often proud, rude, showy and pushy simply because they
      feel they have all the good ideas and are as such indispensable. Do not
      allow power get into your head. What you have is just an opportunity to
      serve. You really may not have gotten to the leadership position because
      you are the most qualified for the post. Very few of those who are really
      qualified for it are lucky enough to get the opportunity to serve among
      youths. This is why you should not abuse the privilege given to you. It is
      a rare one.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not disappoint whoever it is that has
      given you the opportunity to lead. Do not let your followers regret having
      you as a leader. It is a common saying that power corrupts, but do not let
      this saying be confirmed during your stay in office.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is a deadly perception to make the costly
      assumption that the whole organization revolves around you. The
      organization will function quite well with or without you. There were
      other leaders in the past who occupied the same post you are occupying
      today; many of them thought that no one could fit adequately in their
      place when they were about to leave, but that was proved wrong. You will
      not be the last person to man the sit. Someone else will still come after
      you. So, you will be doing yourself a lot of good if you constantly remind
      yourself that the office is a temporary one, it is not a family title nor
      is it a life time post.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is possible that you unconsciously begin
      to think that you are perfect. Some leaders are of the opinion that things
      happening around them happen because of what they do, what they know, and
      who they are. They think they are the best things that ever happened to
      their group, and so, are indispensable.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Watch it; whatever happens, do not let it go
      into your head; it is not you, it is God. You are human and can still make
      mistakes. That you have had a number of perfect ideas that worked out well
      does not mean all your ideas will be perfect.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Pride is an ever present enemy of leaders.
      It has been said that the strongest chains break at the weakest point.
      Pride is that point for many leaders. All leaders constantly face an
      uncontrollable urge to exhibit self-promotion. Beware, anytime you begin
      to get so crazy and want to singularly get all the credit for the progress
      made so far, Pride is about to set in.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not put yourself on a pedestal too high.
      Remember the poem you learnt in primary school: He that is down needs fear
      no fall. Never accord to yourself more respect or honor than you deserve.
      Never give to yourself more credit than you are supposed to, neither allow
      others force you to. Trim yourself and cut yourself to size from time to
      time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>RESPECTS ALL FOLLOWERS</b><br>
      Respect your followers. You are a leader, not a boss. The fact that you
      have a measure of influence over them does not make them your servants.
      Everybody deserves some level of respect.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Value your followers. Recognize each
      individual’s difference and respect it. Your leadership does not give you
      the liberty to address them carelessly. Watch your words. Do not be rude
      or offensive. Handle everyone with care. Apologize to anyone if you need
      to. You cannot correct disobedience in others if you do what is wrong and
      refuse to apologize.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Remember, respect is reciprocal. Respect
      yourself and you will be respected; respect others, and you will be
      respected the more. Others will treat you the way you relate to them. If
      you respect them, they will respect you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Another advantage of showing respect to them
      is that when you show respect to your followers, it builds their
      self-esteem and self-confidence, and the greater their self-esteem and
      confidence, the better they appreciate you, their leader, and the more
      committed they will be to your dream and your regime.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are seven major things you need to
      respect about your followers.<br>
      1. Respect their opinions and ideas.<br>
      2. Respect their time.<br>
      3. Respect them as humans.<br>
      4. Respect their commitment to you.<br>
      5. Respect their contribution to your dream.<br>
      6. Respect their relationships.<br>
      7. Respect their achievements.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>MAN OF INTEGRITY</b><br>
      Leadership among youths is either by election or by appointment. Whichever
      category you fall into, you will need to maintain a life of integrity.
      Integrity is defined as moral uprightness. Have a high standard of
      morality.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a leader, your most prized possession is
      your integrity. You must not lose it. It is most likely that you are still
      quite young and do not know the possibilities that the future holds for
      you. So, guard your integrity.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever impression these ones you lead have
      of you today will last a long time. So, if you aspire that your leadership
      skills be extended beyond the youths to the society at large, you will
      need to build for yourself a great name and protect your integrity today
      for the sake of the future.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Even if you are neither elected
      nor appointed, this fact does not mean you are not accountable and
      answerable to anybody. You are responsible to God. Your followers may be
      mere youths today; tomorrow, some of them may become a voice in the
      country or may be in the position to determine the destinies of men to be
      elected or appointed into positions of authority. They will, likely,
      remember you then, either for good or for bad.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Integrity needs to be at the very core of
      your being. It should form the basic foundation of your leadership. If
      your leadership responsibility is directly under another leader’s
      supervision; be honest in your dealings with him. Do not try to blackmail
      him or kick him out of office in order to take over power from him.
      Putting out the candles of others will not make yours shine brighter. Do
      not aspire to outdo him by unjust methods. If you are destined to be
      there, at God’s own time he will lift you higher in his own way and that
      will be more honorable.<br>
      Make a solemn determination to live a straightforward and truthful life,
      whether someone is looking or not. Men of integrity will do in the public
      what they would do in the secret and vice versa.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Your integrity will gain for you more
      respect than you can ever purchase with eye service. Power, position,
      authority, may make your followers obey you (either willfully or
      forcefully) but they will not grant you respect. Respect is earned, and
      its price is integrity.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Integrity is more important than success.
      Most times, your integrity guarantees your success. If what you are after
      is success by all means, you may trade your integrity for it. However, if
      you try to guard your integrity jealously, success, popularity and fame
      will come looking for you someday.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Ethical and moral standards must be
      maintained. You will, of surety, face opposition in its multifaceted
      forms, but always stand for the truth. Men of integrity always stand for
      what they know to be right, even in the face of great antagonism, and most
      times, at an unbearable personal cost.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> You cannot have peace if you sacrifice
      truth. Always say the truth, come what may; it will someday come back to
      vindicate you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY</b><br>
      Be accountable, especially when it comes to the flow of funds. Financial
      accountability is a must. Monetary issues must be handled with all
      transparency.<br>
      As a leader, your testimony as regards finances must not be questionable.
      Your life must be open enough for all men, especially your followers, to
      see. Live above suspicion and reproach as much as you can.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Do not be selfish. Think of others
      primarily. Your first priorities must be for the benefit of your followers
      and not yours. Nothing stirs up anger and rebellion among youths more than
      discovering that their leader is only interested in using his privileged
      position to selfishly acquire wealth, fame and connections for himself
      alone without performing that for which he is elected.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Actually, there is nothing wrong in using
      your position to justly accumulate wealth, acquire fame, and contact
      needed connections, but this should not be your priority. It should come
      naturally as a reward of your meritorious service to humanity. If it
      becomes your primary objective, you are sure to miss the mark. Face your
      job squarely, and every other thing will come as dividends of your
      selfless effort.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Put service to others first. Your desire
      must be to move the people forward. If your focus in office is mainly to
      acquire wealth before your tenure is over, you will bend the rules for
      money. The focus should be to be a blessing, then the money will freely
      flow in. The magnitude of the problem you solve during your administration
      will determine the reward that will come to you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Do not set out with an intention to be
      rich. Set out with an intention to serve others in every way you can. If
      wealth is your all-consuming goal, you will soon be consumed by the fiery
      furnace it will create. Building your organization will benefit you much
      more than building your bank account.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Beware of money. Any leadership devoid of
      financial integrity is poor leadership. Make sure every fund is used for
      what it is budgeted for. If it has to be diverted to other means, make
      sure it is with the consent of at least a major part of the decision
      makers, if not all.<br>
      Do not indulge in any act that will bring disgrace to your office. Purify
      yourself from everything that contaminates your exalted office. Do not
      succumb to that greedy and selfish spirit that exists among most leaders
      out there. Place the need of your organization ahead of your personal
      aspirations. Ask yourself this question: “am I in this leadership position
      to bless and affect lives or to bless and affect my own pocket alone?”</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Maintain a disciplined lifestyle. So many
      youths are of the opinion that leadership is about embezzlement of funds.
      They have it written somewhere in their brain that no youth vie for a
      leadership position simply for the sake of humanitarian service but for
      selfish ambitions.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Once these ones begin to see you live
      beyond the normal average life you used to live before you get to the
      position of authority, they conclude you are already emptying their
      treasuries to better your lot. So, be careful the way you live. Watch what
      you spend money on. Watch what you wear. Watch what you eat. Be contented
      with yourself and be contented with the funds available to you for
      personal use.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Even if you make genuinely clean money
      while in the office (this is possible once in a while but it is not always
      the case; a higher percentage of money gotten in office is not clean
      money), rather than spend such money to buy the latest electronic gadgets,
      wears, handset, or cars, it makes more sense to invest such for the
      future.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This will divert the attention of the
      youths from you, thereby saving you unnecessary hassles. Once you are out
      of the office, you can enjoy your hard earned money with no one closely
      monitoring your life. Apply this wisdom, it is profitable.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Financial accountability will save you from
      being irresponsible. It will also save you from unconsciously creating
      imbalances.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>SEXUAL PURITY</b><br>
      Another character of a good leader is sexual purity. The ability to
      control your sexual urge will go a long way in determining what kind of
      leader you are.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="settings">
										 <p style="text-align: justify;">Some leaders are loose when they are around
      members of the opposite sex. Their moral level, when it comes to sexual
      dealings, is ridiculous. As a leader of the youths, you must know how to
      present yourself as a man of sexual integrity.<br>
      If you are already engaged, or married, be faithful to your spouse. Do not
      have extramarital affairs. Let what you have be enough for you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> If you are still single, enjoy
      your singleness. Do not use your privileged position as a way of
      displaying your sexual prowess. Live a chaste life. If you must be
      engaged, let the process of making your choice be clean and void of
      stories of sexual harassment. Be an exemplary leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Recognize the need for personal discipline
      in your sexual life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>SELFLESS SERVICE</b><br>
      Youth leadership is all about service. Most often, the authority to lead
      comes naturally to those who selflessly offer genuine service to the
      people. This is because the very heart of leadership is service.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Selfishness and self-centeredness are the
      undoing of most leaders. Your responsibility, being a leader, is to serve
      others. Most people in leadership have problems with this. The last thing
      they want to do is serve others. They will rather be lord of lords. The
      assumption is that since the leader is at the top of the leadership rank,
      others below should, of necessity, serve him. However, things do not work
      this way.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> To be a good leader, you must live a
      selfless life. Leading itself is spelt S-E-R-V-I-C-E. A leader who cannot
      serve well cannot lead well. Serving others is leadership in action. You
      must be ready to serve the two classes of people in your followership: the
      appreciative and the unappreciative.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Good Leaders give more than words and
      knowledge to others; they give themselves for the benefit of others. They
      are generous with their time and energy. They serve others by listening,
      supporting, encouraging, affirming, confronting, helping, loving,
      empathizing with others, and being there when they are needed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Your desire must always be to serve and not
      to be served. You are not a director, you are a leader. A director sits
      down, folds his hands and directs people on what to do. A leader gets to
      the venue of the projects, and is the first to do what he expects others
      to do.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> This was Jesus’ style of leadership; the
      leader of all is the servant of all.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>RESOURCE MANAGER</b><br>
      One prominent challenge you will face is scarce resources. Most of the
      things you will want to do may not really get done the best way you
      desired to. A number of factors will be responsible for this:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> 1. You do not have all the human resources
      you need<br>
      2. You do not have all the financial resources you need<br>
      3. You do not have all the material resources you need<br>
      4. You do not even have full control over the available resources.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> With all these limitations, you will still
      need to make up your mind to do your best to complete every project you
      undertake under whatever circumstance you find yourself in, in other to
      save your face and to maintain your integrity. Your success rate is
      measured by what you accomplished and not just what you started.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> It is left to you to know how to manage
      these scarce resources for the progress of your projects. Look beyond what
      you do not have to what you have. To keep lamenting over what you do not
      have is to waste what you have.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Man naturally underrates what he has and
      overrates what he does not have. Look inward. With proper planning and
      judicious management of available resources, you can still perform
      wonders. Give the best in whatever circumstance you find yourself, with
      the resources available to you at the time.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>COURAGEOUS IN HIS ACTIONS</b><br>
      A leader needs courage. To achieve your set goals, you need a strong level
      of confidence in yourself and in your ability as a leader. No one will
      believe in you if you do not believe in yourself. No one wants to follow a
      coward.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Youths want leaders they can look up to;
      someone who can be their hero and lead them all the way through. If you do
      not portray yourself as one you will soon have a divided house. If you are
      not bold enough, you will lose the youths to a follower who can take the
      lead boldly. They will revolt against you and<br>
      choose their own leader, and this does not take youths time to do.
      Although you may still be lucky to retain the title, someone else will be
      carrying out the functions attached to the title. You will only be a
      figurehead.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Whatever time it will take you, build up
      courage in yourself. Exercise courage in all circumstances, whether the
      chips are up or down. Even when doubts prevail and hope for the future
      erodes in your heart, let courage show on your face whenever you appear in
      public.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>HONEST IN HIS DEALINGS</b><br>
      Honesty, they say, is the best policy. Be honest; keep your activities
      above reproach, both before God and men. Stand for the truth, even in the
      face of opposition. Do not allow yourself to be pushed around. Maintain
      your stand.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Honesty gives you credibility. It builds
      trust and faith in your followers. Tell them the truth the way it is.
      Never be found to make untrue statements for whatever cause, just or
      unjust. If you want the youths to accept you as a godly role model, then
      you must live a godly life. Do not amplify facts or figures. Do not
      exaggerate issues, augment statistics or cook up testimonies to back up
      your words. Say it the way it is.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Do not pretend to be a know-it-all leader.
      Tell them the little you know and let them know you will get back to them
      after consulting with higher authorities. If asked a question about which
      you have no answer, let them know. This will neither reduce you nor make
      them look down on you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> You do not have to say anything if you do
      not have to. It will make them respect you the more as a sincere leader,
      and they are likely to open up to you the more about more critical issues
      in their personal lives which they have kept secret from their parents.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Honesty is the key to successful
      leadership. Operate in openness, fairness and uprightness in all of your
      dealings. It will foster unity between you and your followers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>GENEROUS WITH APPRECIATION</b><br>
      Be generous with appreciation; a good leader is quick to praise.
      Appreciate the commitment of others to your goals. Every worthwhile and
      constructive contribution to the success of your goal, no matter how
      minute, must be credited. Every accomplishment, big or small, must be
      recognized. This will keep the youths interested in you, and in your
      leadership goals.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> God will not connect you to new people if
      you are messing up with the ones around you. Always express appreciation
      for work done. This can be by writing short appreciation notes, making
      phone calls, text messages and e-mails. These will build their morale the
      more and spur them to better action when next their services are required.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Good words satisfy. Sweet words soothe.
      Word of praise nourishes. People cooperate more when they are appreciated
      than when they are reproached. Great comments stir up greater feats.
      Commendations give them inner confidence: it encourages the people to
      achieve more. Do not take them for granted.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Beyond their commitment to you, praise
      every noticeable personal improvement in the lives of your followers and
      encourage others to imitate them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>HE IS PATIENT</b><br>
      It takes time to get the full cooperation of youths. Contrary to what you
      want, they will not all give you their support overnight. You will have to
      earn it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> You must be patient with them while they
      decide whether to cooperate with you for the success of your ideas or to
      stay on their own. Do not be forceful. Do not be pushy. Do not be too
      hasty. Do not pressure them to respond to you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Give them time to get used to you and your
      style of operation. It is only then that their cooperation will come
      wholeheartedly, and then long lasting. If you force them into supporting
      you before it comes from their hearts, the best you will get from them is
      partial obedience and eye service, and you will not really enjoy them as
      much as you should.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> So, a good leader will need patience to
      handle them, not just to get their cooperation at the beginning of his
      administration alone, but to enjoy a good team work with them all through
      the period of his tenure.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>HE IS TOLERANT</b><br>
      In addition to your patience, you will also need to be tolerant. There are
      things you may not like to accommodate but you will have to learn to
      tolerate them for the sake of peace. Tolerance is the ability to accept or
      forbear what one may not naturally permit.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Since you are leading the youths, you will
      definitely need to tolerate some of their excesses, as long as it does not
      bring any major setback to the general wellbeing and the unity of the
      group, and it does not have a genuine conflict with the scriptures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> There will be times when you will feel like
      screaming at some of them and shouting them down. Please be careful to
      restrain yourself, at least in the public. Put your emotions under check
      else it will interfere with your work.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Do not be quick to condemn or criticize. Do
      not show personal hatred for anyone because of his excesses. Do not take
      things too personal. Be reasonable. Be willing to take insults from others
      without a feeling of hostility. In fact, ignore insult; because you will
      have more than you can handle! A whole chapter in this book is dedicated
      to how to handle criticism and insult. This is to show you how important
      it is. Be tolerable.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>HE IS FORGIVING</b><br>
      People will often hurt you, so be prepared to forgive them in advance.
      Forgive every critic. Forgive every workforce. Forgive every executive.
      Forgive every youth. Forgive your protégés. Forgive your mentors if need
      be.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The sign of maturity in a leader is not in
      how many times he has been hurt but how fast he recovers from each of the
      hurts. Forgive everyone who offends you each time they do, whether they
      deserve it or not. Forgive as often as possible. A good leader is always
      quick to forgive and he is never slow to ask for forgiveness where
      applicable.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>HE IS APPROACHABLE</b><br>
      Be conscious of the things happening around you. Let every member of your
      group, as much as possible, have access to you. Be friendly and welcoming.
      Do not build fences around yourself. The door that is created to lock
      others out also shuts you in.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Be charming. Always wear a good look with a
      warm smile. It will bring people closer to you. Learn to smile a lot, you
      are not a military president. A good leader is more of the image of Jesus
      of Nazareth who goes about doing good, than that of the Lion of the tribe
      of Judah. Your position as a leader, coupled with the authority and power
      available to you may create in you a tendency to want to intimidate others
      unconsciously. Guard against it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Make yourself reachable. Do not become a
      god to your people. Be available when they need you. Put measures in place
      that will ensure that your followers who seriously need your attention get
      it before it is too late (as much as your time will allow you).</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>HE KEEPS PROMISES</b><br>
      Do not make promises you cannot keep. Be a man of your word. The thin line
      between trust and distrust is in how much of your promises you keep.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The more of your promises you keep, the
      more the trust your followers will have in you, and the more their
      confidence in your ability.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> When you constantly disappoint them, saying
      things you cannot do, irrespective of the reasons you may have for failing
      them, they will not find reasons to want to trust you again. This will be
      disastrous to your leadership.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> A good leader always promises what he can
      deliver, but tries to outdo his own promises so that at the end of the
      day, he has done much more than his followers are expecting from him. This
      gains him more respect and love from his people.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>HE RAISES OTHER LEADERS</b><br>
      There is little to what you can, single-handedly, do alone. Rather than
      focus only on his ability, a good leader concentrates on developing other
      leaders who will make a positive difference.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> You will always have more to do than you
      will have time to do them. Therefore, your impact only becomes a lasting
      one if you can develop more genuine leaders from your followers who also
      will develop other leaders.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Jesus had only twelve disciples. Today, the
      world is filled with millions of Christian leaders who still trace their
      roots down to Him. He only deposited Himself into twelve people and the
      twelve passed the legacy on to numerous others, and that way, He has been
      able to engrave the continuity of His leadership and His doctrine on the
      rock of eternity.</p>
