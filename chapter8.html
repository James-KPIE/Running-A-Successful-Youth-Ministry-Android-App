    <h2 style="text-align: center;">DELEGATE RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One way in which you can explore and
      maximize the potentials in your followers is to delegate responsibilities
      to them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Successful leadership among youth requires
      the combined efforts of almost all the youth and their abilities. In youth
      leadership, there is no one-man-army or show. It is more of a general
      contribution of each followers little effort. Everyone needs to be
      involved. It is not all about you and your vision; your people must be
      included.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In leading the youth, leadership is not
      something that is done by the leader for the followers. It is done,
      although by the leader, but with the co-operation and help of the led.
      There is at least something which everyone can contribute.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Cross pollinate ideas with other people. No
      leader succeeds alone. None of us is as good as all of us put together. If
      successful leadership is about intelligence, the most intelligent guys
      around the world would be the best leaders. This is rarely the case. The
      best leaders are not the most intellectual ones around, they are simply
      men who could work well with people and get the best out of them, with
      ease.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Leadership is not all about intelligence or
      brilliance. It is more about understanding the feelings of others and
      knowing how to influence them. Your ability to get other youth to work
      with you, using their unique abilities, will make you a successful leader
      more than anything else.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You are only as good as the people you
      surround yourself with. The greatest leaders in history are not those who
      force, demand or insist, but those who suggest, motivate, and encourage
      others to act. They surround themselves with, get advices and suggestions
      from the best of the best, and so produce the best leadership. If you want
      to be recognized as one of the greatest leaders around, you will also need
      to learn how to delegate responsibilities to the best brains around you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Like attracts like! The people whom your
      leadership will attract will most likely be men who have some character
      traits and talents similar to yours; maximize their abilities by involving
      them. Make use of the people who are ready to contribute their quota in
      fulfilling the joint dream of the organization.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some youth are reserved. They may not freely
      express their abilities or demonstrate their talents until they are laden
      with responsibilities. Involve them by making them responsible for
      something; give them a responsibility.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is tough to be a youth leader today,
      probably tougher than it has ever been. Leadership responsibilities are
      overwhelmingly exhaustive. True leaders face heavier demands every day
      because their schedules are so tight with the number of things they have
      to personally attend to. It will require serious discipline for anyone to
      take his eyes off some of those duties</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">that stare him in the face. Most of these
      are really not as important as they seem. They just distract the leader
      from the more important things by wasting his time and energy.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you really want to leave the office in
      one piece, you will need to discipline yourself enough to take your eyes
      off responsibilities that others can take care of for you. One of the
      major causes of burnout in leadership is the desire to want to do it all
      alone. Most times, leaders concern themselves with what others should do
      and they neglect what they should do. Do not put too many irons in the
      fire at the same time, it is distracting.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to avoid these distractions, any
      activity that is not moving you closer to your goals must be eliminated.
      If it cannot be eliminated, then it should be suspended. If it,
      necessarily, has to be done immediately, delegate it to someone else.
      Rather than be a hard working leader, be a smart working leader. Identify
      what is important for you to do and delegate the rest. Look for your own
      area of giftedness and major on it, encouraging others to give helping
      hands in other areas.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If it is something you and you alone must
      do, postpone it. This done, you can do it in your least productive time
      and have your most productive time for your number one priority. This way,
      you can be a specialist in your own field and also oversee others in their
      fields.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The multitudinous dimension of the task
      ahead will be too difficult for you alone to bear. You need helpmates.
      This is the reality of life. In life, the higher you go, the more
      dependent you are on others. A seventy-year old man will depend on the
      people around him if he will enjoy the remaining years of his life. The</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">things which he had always done with ease by
      himself and for himself before now will be difficult to achieve. It may
      become a suicidal mission if he attempts to do them all by himself.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The same is true of the business world. A
      CEO depends on his cook, cobbler, gateman, laundry man and the like to
      live a good life. A multibillionaire will depend on the trickles of money
      being made by some unknown and insignificant workers in his firm to
      maintain his billions. The moment they all go on strike, his business is
      affected. He cannot, single handedly, undertake everyone’s task; it will
      be a suicide mission.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The same is true of a leader. If you want to
      be in charge of everything, every time, you will kill yourself before
      long. Science has revealed to us that even the sun increases its
      brightness and intensity by shedding a part of its mass every day. You
      also will need to shed some weight of responsibilities. The task before
      you is greater than what you alone can accomplish.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It really does not matter what organization
      you are leading. If you are a youth minister in a church, a singles’
      coordinator, a student union leader, a youth executive or a campus leader,
      and everyone in your team contributes maximally to the fulfillment of your
      dream, the progress you will experience will be immeasurable. This is what
      successful leadership is all about: getting others interested in the joint
      goal of the house for the progress of the organization and keeping them
      that way till the goal is achieved.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every leader needs help. There is simply no
      way one man can do it all alone. You cannot make any meaningful changes
      all by</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">yourself. There are numerous others who can
      do what you cannot. Allow them. That is the way God created the world to
      be. Everyone needs to do, at least, something for someone in order for
      everyone to be happy. That is the way to get jobs done.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You were not ordained a leader to do the
      impossible, but to make possible the possible. If all leaders can get this
      into their heads, there will be a large reduction in the unnecessary
      pressure which they cause themselves. Know what you can handle yourself,
      and what you cannot handle. If you know that you cannot handle a thing,
      seek the expertise of others in the group who you can delegate it to. This
      will not diminish you in any way. You are just a leader, not the
      omnipotent God.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">Being the leader, your most valuable assets
      are the people around you. The best solutions to the greatest problems you
      will have, either in your personal life or in carrying out your official
      duties are in the people around you; make use of them. We all need one
      another. You need them as much as they need you. So, involve them.
      Involving them will give them the experience of personal joy of service.
      With the genuine involvement of everyone, there is going to be corporate
      accomplishment.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is not always so easy to leave the most
      important thing as the most important and delegate others. So, you will
      have to learn to. The secret has always been to do the important things
      first, leaving the less important ones for others to do. People want to
      belong; other youths want to participate actively; so, give them room. You
      major on the majors and minor on minors. This way, they can major on the
      minors, and the results will be all majors.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Delegate responsibilities. Put others to
      work. Be informed about all their activities, but save yourself the full
      and direct involvement in all their operations. You should have more
      important things to do. If you, really, do not have to be there, you do
      not need to be there. If you, really, do not have to do it personally,
      save yourself the stress.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Designate responsibility and watch the
      members of your team work, encouraging them and monitoring them when you
      need to. This way, they can learn on the job and become better at it with
      time. That is the best way for a leader to lead.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the things which you think you only
      can achieve is because you have not given other people the opportunity to
      try their hands on them. If you do, you may discover that some of them
      even have the tendency to do those things better than you, if allowed to
      perfect the skills. Things may not be done the way you desired at the
      initial stage, but you must accept the best which people have to offer as
      their best, encouraging them to improve where possible without too many
      complaints, and give them the opportunity to improve without nursing
      unrealistic expectations of them. No one is perfect. Accept them the way
      they are now. With time, you will be proud of them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Giving yourself to constantly condemning the
      best effort of other people may be very discouraging. Learn to appreciate
      a near-perfect job. This is not being hypocritical. It is maturity. You
      are not deceiving them, you are appreciating what they have done, and at
      the same time telling them they can still do better.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To start with, get the best of the people in
      your group to work with you. Give room to other youths who have strength
      in the areas where you are weak. It will not remove anything from you, it
      can only add to you.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If they handle designated functions better
      than you would have done and it becomes obvious to the populace, it is
      natural to begin to nurse the thoughts that they are trying to compete
      with you. This early sign of jealousy is not unusual, but should not be
      allowed to go beyond this stage. If you are indeed a good leader you
      should appreciate them and give them the healthy respect and the credit
      which is duly theirs without being envious of them. If you do this, they
      will be more submissive than you expect and the result will be to the
      glory of your administration and the credit to your leadership. If you
      start competing with them, you may cause more problems than you can
      handle. Such problems can discredit in few weeks, your many years of
      meritorious service and commitment to the organization.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Encourage co-operation and team work among
      your immediate co-workers. It makes much sense to assign particular duties
      to each of your members, although some should get more, some others less.
      Youths are very active and impatient. If you leave them with nothing to
      do, they naturally become restless, and soon get out of hand, needing to
      be controlled. Look for something each one can do, no matter how little.
      Commend the willing, encourage the unwilling, ensure everybody
      participates. Delegating responsibilities is a demonstration of your trust
      in them and their abilities. It also will build a great working team.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">However, in the name of encouraging
      participation, do not overburden your followers. Make as few demands on
      them as</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">possible. Do not overstretch them Allow them
      stretch themselves to a reasonable extent if they so desire, but do not
      force them to.</p>

										<p style="text-align: justify;">DELEGATE AUTHORITY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not only delegate responsibilities, also
      delegate authority. In fact, never delegate responsibility without
      delegating proportionate authority. Responsibility that is not backed up
      with reasonable and adequate authority will end each attempt at excellence
      in futility. Each time you delegate a responsibility, to make it
      effective, delegate appreciable authority alongside.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not hoard power. Share authority with
      your followers. Once you delegate responsibility, equip them with the
      needed authority to carry out the responsibility. When you delegate
      authority, you empower your delegates to perform. The delegated authority
      serves as an enablement to manifest.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This practice of releasing some level of
      authority to your followers will not make you less authoritative. Every
      time you hold tenaciously to power, rather than portray you as some one
      who really cares for the progress of all and who has the best interest of
      the group at heart, you are seen as a greedy and selfish leader who wants
      to only boss it over all. If you feel comfortable when you are the only
      one in charge, you are not matured enough to be the great leader whom the
      youths desire. You are a boss, and a boss is more of a dictator than a
      leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This generation of youths will likely not
      respond to a dictatorial style of leadership. In the past, the majority of
      the youths were known (or rather forced) to be silent, leaving the
      decision making to the few in leadership and the executives. Now, almost</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">everyone wants to have a say. The earlier
      you understand this, and better still, embrace it, the more successful you
      are likely to become as a leader.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you are truly a leader, you do not have
      to be in control all the time. Once in a while, you surrender control. You
      give your trusted hands some level of freedom to take some minor decisions
      in your absence and to take charge of their positions of responsibility
      authoritatively. If you delegate authority this way; it will come back to
      you in multiple folds.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Trust the people who are handling your
      projects. Mistrust destroys unity and impedes progress. Keep your eyes on,
      but your hands off the responsibilities of the leaders under you, as long
      as they are not failing in their duties. Monitor them closely, but give
      them enough freedom to do it the best way they can.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The more the authority you delegate to
      others, the more respected you become and the more successful your regime
      becomes. Power brings much more profit and lasts longer when it is used to
      empower others.</p>
