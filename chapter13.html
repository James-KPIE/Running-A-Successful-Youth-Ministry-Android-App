    <h2 style="text-align: center;">EFFECTING A CHANGE</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Today’s youth leader will not function
      effectively with methods and mindsets of yesterday. He will need to review
      the approach, style, and methods he meets on ground and ascertain whether
      they are relevant or not and see if there is need for either an upgrade or
      a change. Trying to use the exact same method and skill, which your
      predecessor used without much success and hoping to get a better result,
      is foolhardy. You need to adjust your thinking; you need to see things
      from a different perspective.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do a process evaluation of all of the
      programs and projects you meet on ground. Ask yourself this all important
      question: “Has this method been productive, time saving, and cost
      effective?” If the answer to the three is yes, you really may not have it
      changed except you think there are better alternatives that will help
      achieve the same result in a better way (and be prepared to face serious
      opposition from others for that). However, if your answer is no, then you
      can begin to think of change.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Do not be afraid to upgrade to new standards
      of excellence. Irrespective of human opposition, every tradition that
      wants to hinder you from implementing the necessary changes that are</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">for the good of the organization must be
      addressed on time. What is keeping you from making these necessary
      changes? Is it funds, materials, the youths themselves, the school
      authority, church authority or environmental factors? Disregard the
      resistance; stand against the opposition. Maintain your stand and initiate
      the needed change. Everyone will be the better for it someday.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a means of starting up the crusade for
      change; you can ask your workforce to answer in a written form the
      question “What in this organization needs to change? Answering verbally
      may reduce the impact of the question and water down its effect on them
      but giving them as a take home assignment will task their minds and engage
      their thoughts in a silent review of all the projects at hand such that it
      will be too obvious to the majority that desire changes what needs to be
      changed. This done, your task of convincing them becomes simplified.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">However, be careful. Do not just agree to
      change everything everyone feels needs changing. Take your time to
      critically examine each process before initiating a move. Make sure there
      is a very cogent reason for introducing the change which every one of your
      followers desire, and that there is a very urgent need for it. Then, the
      change can be justified. The reason for the change should not just be for
      the sake of having your name written on people’s minds. It must have a
      purpose - to make life better for your followers.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">THE RISK OF CHANGE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">After deciding on what to change, prepare
      the minds of your followers for the change to expect. You do not expect
      them to make abrupt changes to what they have been doing over the</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">years. They are humans and not robots. You
      will need a lot of persuasion in order to get their full cooperation.
      Unless you are able to successfully persuade them, your dream of creating
      a change may be unrealized.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">You would have thought that present day
      youths, because of their exposure, would be readily willing to accept
      positive changes; but this is not so. Most times, they do not find it that
      easy to adapt to changes too, except when they are seriously persuaded,
      tricked or forced to. They see a re-examination of their methods, styles,
      and principles as shifting base from what used to be obtainable to a
      strange one. The fear of the unknown will make them want to keep on doing
      things the way they did before your tenure.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="profile">
									<p style="text-align: justify;">Change involves a high level of risk! Trying
      to initiate a major change in a youth populated organization without
      adequate preparation for it could be disastrous. You will need to be
      sensitive enough to understand the in-depth feelings of all involved. If
      the change you are initiating comes out successfully at the end of the
      day, you will be esteemed and remembered for life. However, if for
      whatever reasons, it turns out the other way round, you may have your
      image tarnished for life and it may take sometime before anyone asks you
      to come lead any other youth organization again. So, be certain about the
      need for, the purpose of, and to a large extent, the success of the change
      you want to initiate ever before you start the process. Be guaranteed of
      success before taking off.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">THE STAKE HOLDERS OF CHANGE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For any change to be effective, there are
      some people whose support you do not need and there are some you cannot do</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">without. Know which is which. To mistake the
      former for the latter may not be too healthy for the change you are
      canvassing for. Therefore, you will need to be certain you have the
      support of those in whose absence the change cannot materialize.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Spear heading change is difficult. This is
      not just among youths; it is all over. This is because every great idea
      that requires that people change their way of life always generates
      conflicts at the initial stage. Endeavor to ascertain that all those to be
      affected by the change are considered and contacted before the change is
      effected.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the first sets of people to be put
      into consideration are the initiators of the programs you intend to
      change. Every change you propose is always a critique of what is
      obtainable in the past. So, if you must do it successfully, you do not
      have to openly condemn the past leaders or their works. Apply wisdom.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Remember, some of them still have some
      proponents in the organization who will report your bitterness towards
      them frequently. This may generate serious problems for you in your
      pursuit of change. If they have done well, be grateful to them and praise
      them openly so as to garner enough support for yourself, both from them
      and from their advocates. If they have not done well, keep your mouth shut
      about it and face your own business, bearing in mind that your main
      business is not to criticize the past leadership, but to take the group
      forward. This is not politics, it is leadership.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is nothing as devastating to a new
      leader as being criticized by his predecessors openly. This will erode the
      little support and trust which others have in him. To ensure that this</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">does not happen, do not criticize your
      predecessors openly. Treat them specially. Carry them along if need be. If
      you are creating a change that has to do with the foundation any of them
      laid, and you feel the person in question is still very relevant to the
      group, or has a strong influence on it, inform them ahead of the change.
      Let them first hear from you before they hear from external sources.
      Involve them in problems that relate to them. Get their opinions about
      these. Ask them why they did what they did and let them know why you want
      to do what you want to do. Let them see reason with you. You do not have
      to get their 100% consent, just carry them along. Carrying them along in
      this regard simply means letting them know what you want to do and why you
      want to do it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For the change agent, change comes with its
      own agony; be ready for your share. Another of such agony you will have to
      contend with is your followers. Never expect everyone to support your
      change.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Often times, if your followers are like
      other youths, if your strategies are not well planned, the ones you think
      should embrace the change will be the first to resist it. This is not
      enough reason to give up on what you know you should do. It is like that
      everywhere.</p>

                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
											<p style="text-align: justify;">Two major factors are responsible for this:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(1) Fear of the Unknown</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As outgoing as they are, most youths are
      still very reserved when it comes to initiating changes. They are more
      comfortable with the devil they know than trust an angel they know not.
      They prefer to use their own time-tested, proven programs, than</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">jump at new ones. Even if it is so obvious
      that the group is long due for the change, some youths will still be
      skeptical about it. No matter what you say, they will not see the prospect
      of the change you are introducing. What they only focus on is the
      disadvantages if any, or the inconvenience of the period of change. They
      will rather stay in their comfort zone than explore virgin lands.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Loss of Privileges and Authority</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Not everyone gains from change. No matter
      how good the change may be, some youths will lose either their relevance
      in the group or their grip on some privileged opportunities if the change
      is permitted. These youths who are beneficiaries of the old order and are
      sure not to get such esteemed benefits in the new order will fight it to a
      standstill with all their might because they are going to experience some
      visible loss if such change is finally effected.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is no use pretending the change you
      are about to bring will benefit all concerned. This, most likely, will not
      be the complete truth. Such pretence will cause you to ignore the passive
      protest of those who will really need to make personal or corporate
      adjustments in order for the change to be effective. If you neglect these
      ones, they will summon courage to boldly challenge you and see to it that
      you have difficulty succeeding in your bid, if at all you do. They will
      amplify the detriments of the change such that it will overshadow its
      benefits. You will be too shocked that the majority of the youths will
      listen to them, rather than to you. They always shield one another’s
      backs.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These ones are easily noticeable; you cannot
      miss them! Their main question is always “What is wrong with the way we
      used to</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">do it? Why do we have to change it? Once you
      identify any of them, learn how to handle them maturely because the
      success of the change you are about to initiate, to an extent, depends on
      them.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In leadership, from time to time, you will
      definitely be forced to step on some other people’s toes. It is
      inevitable, but the fewer they are, the better. Stepping on their toes may
      not necessarily be because their toes are along the path of the
      fulfillment of your dream. It could be because the path you are creating
      is along the route their toes have always been. These people need to be
      attended to when their toes are stepped on, either intentionally or
      unconsciously.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Learn to handle both the gains and the
      losses of change. The ability to accommodate both those who support and
      those who criticize your actions and programs is an indispensable virtue
      at times like this. Listen to every reasonable critic and carefully
      evaluate them. Some of the best changes you will make will be made after
      listening to some of your opponents and responding honestly to their
      claims.</p>

										<p style="text-align: justify;">Sit them down and talk with them one on one.
      Come to their individual levels. Make them see reason why the change is
      long overdue and necessary at a time like this. Appreciate their concern
      and allay their fears. Count their losses (at least for a few months after
      the change is introduced) and make up for these by integrating them into
      an aspect of your program.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">However, whatever aspect of your program you
      want to compensate them with must be profitable enough to make up for a
      larger percentage of their losses but must not be visible</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">enough to impact your program negatively if
      they decide to turn their backs on you midway. Such youths cannot be fully
      trusted; they may stage an open rebellion, a quiet resistance, or a subtle
      sabotage. So, be careful with them until you are convinced of their
      allegiance.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">RIGHT TIMING FOR CHANGE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is a particular time that is very
      right for every change. The cause of the failure of most leaders who have
      canvassed for change is that of inaccurate timing; either the change came
      too soon before it was needed or later than it was needed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is very easy to be carried away by the
      certainty of the success which will result from the change you desire to
      make without bothering your head about its time. You will need to be
      certain that the time is right for it. This is because it is possible to
      want to do the right thing at the wrong time and vice versa.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Ask yourself honestly:</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">* Is this change needed RIGHT NOW?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">* If it is not done now, will there be any
      grievous consequence?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">* Can this change be delayed? Why?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">* Should it be hastened? Why?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">* Can it be abandoned or annulled? Why?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">* Should it be a temporal change or a
      permanent one?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">* What has the organization been losing in
      the absence of this change?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">* What does it stand to gain if it is
      initiated?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">* What will be the people’s initial reaction
      to the change?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">* Will their attitude change with time,
      after seeing the prospects of this change?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">* What happens if the followers do not like
      the change, even after seeing the prospects?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">* How easy is it to revert back to the
      status quo if there is need for it?</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The questions above, if honestly answered,
      will enable you determine if the time you are proposing for the change is
      ideal and if your followers are ready for the impact of the change you
      want to spearhead.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">THE OTHER SIDE OF CHANGE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Besides initiating changes, a leader must be
      ready to accept changes when necessary. There is no reason to be dogmatic.
      No one is perfect; everyone needs to change from time to time. An average
      leader only shows his willingness to change when the pressure is high.
      This is not the best.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you see reasons why you must, why not? It
      is unethical to fight the voice of reasoning. If you expect them to change
      whenever change is required of them, you also must be ready to change
      whenever it is necessary. Do not be adamant in your operational style.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Be open to changes in your plans. It is a
      great sign of a leader’s maturity. You gain nothing by being unnecessarily
      inflexible. However, you win their hearts by changing your style when
      necessary without being forced to
