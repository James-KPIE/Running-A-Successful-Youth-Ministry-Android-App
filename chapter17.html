    <h2 style="text-align: center;">THE NEED FOR A BALANCED YOUTH MINISTRY</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This chapter was initially written to be the
      first chapter of this book. After careful consideration, it was moved from
      the first to the last, so that it can have a better impact on the readers.
      Do not make up your mind on what the intention of the author is until you
      have read the last word in the chapter.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are so many misconceptions
      about the youth ministry. So many big ministries and churches
      do not believe in this arm of the ministry. They may not say this in
      words, but their actions speak louder than their words.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most ministries do not believe in their
      youths enough to give them free hands to operate in the church. They tend
      to cage them, believing they are not mature enough to handle certain</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">spiritual things. They are treated as babes
      in the Lord, who can only be spoon-fed with the milk of the word.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Unknown to them, most of these youths they
      still refer to as spiritual babies, have handled serious leadership
      positions at various levels in school, both primary and tertiary, and have
      been able to deliver results that are astounding, to the progress of their
      school fellowships and the work of God on their campuses.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some other ministries who pride themselves
      in the freedom they have given to their youths only run this arm as a
      Single's Ministry. All they ever discuss in the weekly youth meetings are
      issues about sex and relationships, as though that is the only important
      area of their lives. Little or nothing is said about personal development,
      about career building, about financial security, and about building a
      legacy after one is long gone.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Other ministries run theirs like a social
      gathering. The youths only meet on special days: say public holidays, so
      as to get familiar with one another. They go on excursions to the beach
      and other places of interests, host love feasts, and organize praise
      nights so as to form a bond of unity amidst themselves.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are still some who are very religious
      about it. They run the youth group as an arm of the church that meets
      either monthly or bimonthly and the order of program for these services
      have nothing youth-like or youth-oriented in them. All they do is to
      indoctrinate the youths with beliefs and traditions of their
      denominations, and they expect the youths to swallow them all, hook, line
      and sinker, without a question. Any youth that raises a question is termed
      a rebel and is blackmailed out-</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">rightly. Some of these beliefs have been in
      existence before the advent of biro and paper, and are seen by the youths
      as out-dated, especially when there is no candid scriptural evidence to
      back them up.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">All of these four approaches of running the
      youth arm of the church that are mentioned above are not balanced enough
      for a youth church of the 21st century.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">For the purpose of this study, The Youth
      Ministry is defined as an arm of the larger ministry or church that is
      specially designed to meet the basic fundamental needs of the youths in
      the ministry.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One can safely conclude from the definition
      above that the major essence of a youth arm of the ministry is to meet the
      special needs that are unique and peculiar to the youths, especially in
      that ministry. The main challenge with the church of today is that they
      want to use the youths in the church, whose peculiar needs have neither
      been addressed nor met, to meet the needs of the other youths outside the
      church.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is where the problem of the 21st
      century church is. There doesn’t seem to be much difference between the
      youth who are expected to be used by God to bring in the other youths into
      the church and the youths they expect them to bring in. The church has put
      the cart before the horse. Until the needs of the youths in the church are
      met, it is going to be a herculean task trying to use them to bring in
      other youths to the fold whose needs also need to be met.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One can safely conclude that the church
      today does not understand the place of the youths in the end time harvest
      that the Lord has promised his church. If she does, she will appreciate
      the importance of these youths enough to meet their needs, and these
      youths whose needs have been met will in turn bring in more youths whose
      needs need to be met, without being forced to.</p>

										<p style="text-align: justify;">IMPORTANCE OF A YOUTH MINISTRY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Shortly before we consider the needs of
      today's youths, let us examine the importance of a youth ministry. It is a
      popular knowledge that when the purpose of a thing is not known, the abuse
      of it is grossly inevitable. The reason why most pastors and churches
      abuse the presence of the youths in their churches is because their eyes
      have not yet been opened to the purpose of this unique group.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Discussed below are reasons why every church
      should run a youth arm, and do it right.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">1. FOR CONTINUITY</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">One major reason every church organization
      should be encouraged to start a youth arm is for the continuity of the
      church doctrines. The uniqueness and beliefs of each denomination is
      better passed down to the youths who will still stay around for a longer
      time than the adults who are already on their way out of the dance floor
      of life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most churches do not include these youths in
      the vital decision making process of the church, either as contributors or
      spectators. All they do is just tell the youths of the decisions they have
      arrived at. The youths that are expected to defend the</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">course of the church tomorrow, long after
      the adults are gone, do not even know the reason for the course, talk less
      of believe in such course. This is why some good churches do not stay
      around for too long. They wither away after the first few generations.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is commonplace to see that these youths
      only manage to cope in these churches basically because it is their
      parent’s church, and they have no choice. As long as they are under the
      roof of their parents, they have to attend these churches. This is forced
      submission.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Such youths, after gaining admission to the
      university, with a little air of freedom, change their church immediately
      or at worst, wait until they graduate, or marry, and then relocate to
      where they can choose by themselves what church meets their needs.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This seems to be the reason why the youth
      population in the new generation churches seems to be growing in leaps and
      bounds, and it seems the traditional church is only trying to catch up
      with them. The new generation churches are readily meeting the needs of
      the youths while the traditional churches feel the youths are just a bunch
      of Sunday Morning Bench Warmers whose attendance is only needed to
      increase the population of the church.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Every church that desires to cross
      boundaries and impact more than one generation must have a representation
      of the youths in each of the arms of the ministry, including the highest
      decision making council. It is not so much that the youths can show off at
      these meetings, but for continuity sake.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">2. TO AVOID CLASHES</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is always a cold war, a constant
      silent battle, between the old school and the new school. This is caused
      by the differences in the belief system of those who still hold rigidly to
      traditional way of doing things and that of the new generation believers
      who, though appreciate the scriptures, however feel that the old school
      have read their personal meanings to what some part of the scriptures say,
      and as such are misinterpreting scriptures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the points of clashes between the
      two schools are things like the dress code, dance steps, hair styles,
      adornments with jewelries and the like.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most of these things that the outgoing
      generation frowns at are seen by the incoming generation as the order of
      the day. Hence, the adults feel the youths are carnal minded and not
      committed spiritually to the things of God, while the youths feel that the
      adults are overzealous, and that this zeal without balanced knowledge
      makes them look too spiritual for their own kind of belief.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This age long battle has made many leading
      churches in times past lose their relevance among the youths and these
      churches are on the brink of going into extinction today.</p>
										</div>
                                        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
										<p style="text-align: justify;">The main reason the adults give to support
      this action that the youths will rather see as extra biblical ordinances
      is that most of these things which the youths want to do are strange to
      our culture. They are quick to forget that, although the elders grew up
      under a particular culture and so can keep defending traditions and
      cultural practices on which the Bible does not</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">have a strong stand, the youths of today
      grew up under a mixed culture in a global village and it may not be easy
      to force them to conform into the demands of a particular cultural setting
      they were not used to.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Although the youths may have their own
      excesses which the outgoing generation must not fail to correct, the
      adults must learn to stop exactly where the scriptures stopped, and be
      silent where the scripture is silent, so that they will not be seen as
      unconsciously defending the cultures and the traditions of men in the name
      of defending the scriptures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">3. TO HAVE LIBERTY OF WORSHIP</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Youths like to do things their own way, as
      long as it is not against the written Word of God. They have their own
      style of speech that they all understand but may be strange to the adults.
      They have their dance steps, hip hop styled praise songs, loud eardrum
      bursting worship songs, and the like.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Their idea of what a worship service should
      look like is entirely different from that of the older generation. While
      one believes that the sanctuary should have some sanctity with as little
      noise and distractions as possible, the other believes that the difference
      between a mortuary and a sanctuary is the noise. So, organized
      distractions are allowed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These, most times, do not go down well with
      the older generations who may see them as going too far and taking God for
      granted. With this type of mind-set, it becomes almost impossible for one
      group to, wholeheartedly, worship in the presence of the other without
      being aggrieved or offended. This</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">difference in opinion is caused by the
      generation gap between the two parties.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This realization which the church has failed
      to come to terms with has been identified long ago by experts in the
      marriage counseling programs. They discovered that when a man marries a
      woman who is 10-15years younger than he is, they are likely to have some
      issues at the family front which is not common to those whose age
      differences are not that far apart. This is because they are not of the
      same generation, and the wider the generation gap, the more the issues
      they have to contend with.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is the same issues we have in church
      today. We expect that people of diverse generations will worship together
      under the same atmosphere peacefully. The father is 60years of age, the
      mother is 55years, the firstborn is 30years and the last born is 15years.
      They all have different views about life, and we will expect all of them
      to worship together under the same roof for years without any issues? We
      will expect that the preacher will preach one single message and still
      meet the needs of all of them, and do that for 52 Sundays in a year!</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The way out before now is to suppress the
      youths and force them to endure the adults’ way of worship all through the
      year, or better still, give them one Sunday in the year, called their
      youth anniversary, or youth week, to have their way. In most churches,
      from experience, there is always a problem after such anniversary because
      one adult got offended at one youth’s behavioral attitude in church that
      day.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This, most times, is always the issue. The
      older people complain that the younger people’s style and mode of worship
      is</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">becoming a stumbling block to numerous other
      elders who want to worship God but will not think of it because of the way
      the youths worship. They always forget that the reverse of that statement
      is also true. Except for those whose parents attend some of these
      traditional churches, so many youths also will not think of going to
      church if this is the only church around where they live. The elders are
      also unconsciously, in the name of defending the faith, becoming a
      stumbling block to the youths.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The final solution now is for the youths to
      live a hypocritical life, since there is no freedom of worship. They stay
      in the church, but tune their receiving antennal off. This is why you
      notice that, if they find themselves in a large meeting, youths hardly sit
      in one place. They move about in large numbers, chatting and playing. If
      it is a small meeting where they can be easily noticed by their parents,
      rather than move around, what they do is bring out their gadgets, cell
      phones or whatever, and then connect to a larger audience outside the
      meeting place through a social media site.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As much as this attitude is not to be
      encouraged, they do this simply to while away time, since they cannot flow
      with whatever worship style they have found themselves in. Those who do
      not want to live this hypocritical life are likely to withdraw from the
      church and find a more comfortable church around if their parents agree
      with them.</p>

										<p style="text-align: justify;">This is why every ministry needs to start
      floating a youth arm: to give the youths liberty of worship.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">4. TO CREATE A SENSE OF BELONGING</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone appreciates something he can call
      his own, rather than manage that of another. A youth arm of the church
      will give the youths a sense of belonging. It will not be their parent's
      church. It will be their church.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Once you give the youths this type of
      opportunities, they will do all in their power to see the church grow.
      Most times, such churches have grown much more than their mother churches
      in numerical strength. The youths who have not been too involved before in
      the main church will be more committed now, having found a place of
      expression for his inner gifts. Their workforce will increase and their
      evangelism will bring great growth.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">5. A PLACE OF REFUGE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Many youths are out there today who though
      have lost it, but have realized their present sinful state, and are
      willing to give Christ a trial. These youths have indulged in so many
      unthinkable things in their days of ignorance, but have now realized their
      need for the Savior and are ready to yield to Him.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">However, most times, the physical look of
      these youths does not really represent the progressive transformation that
      is on-going in their souls. They still look like who they really are - a
      sinner that needs the touch of the Savior to become a saint.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If these ones mistakenly get into a church
      designed traditionally for the elders, they feel so out of place and
      uncomfortable and may likely withdraw back to the world. To make matters
      worse, some church will not even allow such to come into their place of
      worship, talk less of giving them an opportunity to meet with the Savior
      who can fully transform both their soul and their body.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These churches need to be reminded that, in
      case they have forgotten, the church may today look like an association of
      saints on their way to heaven, but it is primarily a group of sinners on
      their way to hell, blood washed by the lamb and turned saints so they can
      turn other sinners to saints.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Such youths as described above may find a
      youth church to be a place of refuge where they can hide their heads
      pending the time when the Lord will perfect the on-going transformation,
      both in their spiritual lives and their physical look.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">CREATING THE NEEDED BALANCE</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The main targets of the devil’s kingdom in
      these last days are not the elders; he is already giving up on them. His
      warfare is targeted more at the future generations. That is why all of the
      cultural wars in churches are primarily to discourage the youths from
      giving their best of service to the Lord. Satan knows that once you can
      capture the leaders of tomorrow today, it becomes easy for him to control
      the followers of tomorrow at will, and as such, it becomes increasingly
      easy to silence the church of tomorrow when the time comes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">With this in mind, the elders of the church
      should do their best to encourage the youths to offer their heartfelt
      service to God, and not place much more burdens on them than the
      scriptures has placed. The elders need to stand for the truth by earnestly
      fighting for the truth, both in their generation and in the incoming
      generation. They need to guide the youths on how to walk before God
      perfectly and how not to fulfill the desires of the flesh.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The leaders of today need to teach the
      leaders of tomorrow why they cannot always have their ways when it comes
      to spiritual matters. However, in doing this, they must support their
      arguments and claims from the standpoint of the scriptures, and not just
      from personal experiences or biased mindsets. The youths will believe more
      in the testimony of a rightly divided word of truth than in the words of
      the doctrinal book of their denomination.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The outgoing generation should spiritually
      equip the youths to prepare them adequately for the real war the devil is
      waging against the existence of the church and not allow generational
      differences, traditional mindsets and cultural wars to put a division
      between them and the great army the Lord is building to fight His course
      in these last days.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, the leaders of tomorrow
      also need to know that one cannot serve God and mammon together. This
      generation needs to be very careful because the line between worldliness
      and godliness in getting thinner by the day, and if one is not careful in
      this age and time, one can keep dribbling here and there around the touch
      line, still thinking one is still within the safe haven, without knowing
      he has crossed over the touchline. This may be catastrophic. This is why
      the Corinthians were admonished: whoever thinks he is still in good
      standing should always be careful to examine himself from time to time,
      lest he falls before he realizes.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This generation needs a teachable spirit,
      humble heart and obedience to always listen when the elders talk. They
      need to know that their desires to embrace, exhibit, and adopt the end
      time mode of dressing, dancing, talking, thinking, acting and</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">reacting while yearning for freedom to
      ‘serve and worship’ the Holy God, if care is not taken, may cause them to
      begin to take actions that contradict the postulations of the scriptures.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">If we need to have a balanced church, these
      two seemingly warring factions must learn to see things from the eyes of
      the scriptures, unpolluted by either the old school reasoning that still
      holds onto what was obtainable in the past and will not want to see what
      God is doing today, or by the new school mentality that wants to sacrifice
      godliness and contentment for an opportunity to look more like the world
      on daily basis. The truth must be told: the more of the world they
      resemble, the less of Christ they manifest.</p>
